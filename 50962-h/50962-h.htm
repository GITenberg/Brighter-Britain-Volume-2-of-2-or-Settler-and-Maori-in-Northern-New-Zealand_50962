<small>OUR SPECIAL PRODUCTS</small>.</h2>


<p>Northern New Zealand has two special products,
which are peculiar to the country, and found nowhere
else. They are kauri timber and kauri-gum.
When speaking of Northern New Zealand in these
sketches, I do not thereby intend the whole of the
North Island, as has been previously explained; I
mean that northern part of it which may be more
properly designated "The Land of the Kauri."</p>

<p>The kauri grows throughout all that part of the
old province of Auckland which lies to the north of
S. lat. 37° 30' or 38°. It does not grow naturally
anywhere south of the thirty-eighth parallel of
latitude, nor, I believe, can it be induced to flourish
under cultivation south of its natural boundary line.</p>

<p>The kauri is indigenous to this comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
small section of New Zealand. It is one of the
<i>Coniferæ</i>, or pines, and is named by botanists
<i>Dammara Australis</i>. The only tree of similar
species that affords a timber nearly resembling the
kauri, though not of such good quality, is one that
is found in Fiji; the <i>Dammara Vitiensis</i>. It may
be as well to mention that kauri and Maori rhyme together,
and are pronounced "kowry" and "mowry."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The kauri was first brought into notice by
Captain Cook, who, it will be remembered, passed
many months in New Zealand altogether, and the
greater part of the time in the north. He discovered
that kauri was superior to Norway pine, or indeed,
to any other wood then known, for spars and topmasts
of vessels. Other explorers endorsed his
opinion of it, and in 1820 the British Government
sent a ship, the <i>Dromedary</i>, to New Zealand, for
the purpose of obtaining kauri timber. It was then
classed high at Lloyd's.</p>

<p>Subsequently a demand for kauri timber arose in
Sydney and elsewhere. Some trade in it was established
with the Maoris; and little communities of
English sawyers settled here and there along the
coast of New Zealand. This was one among other
causes that led to the colonization of the country in
1840. Thus the kauri holds a place in history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
having had its share in making this our Brighter
Britain.</p>

<p>The value of the kauri to New Zealand at large,
and to the North in particular, can hardly be overrated.
It is an important export, being sent to other
parts of the colony, to Australia, the South Sea
Islands, and elsewhere. In its own country it is
used for every purpose to which timber is applicable.
The many other trees of the bush are neglected for
the sake of it; while it is more plentiful than any of
them. Settlers in other parts of the colony, beyond
the limit of the kauri's growth, make use of their
native timbers, but lament that the cost of transport
prevents them from importing kauri, so much superior
is it. Wherever it is necessary to bring timber from
a distance, as in comparatively treeless Otago for
example, kauri is preferred; though it will have to
be brought from further away than totara, miro,
or matai, which are cut in southern forests.</p>

<p>One may say that the kauri is to Northern New
Zealand what the oak has been to England, and
even more. There, houses are built of it almost exclusively;
it is used in the construction of vessels,
for fencing, furniture, and all the more general purposes.
And its valuable resin is the kauri gum of
commerce; but that I must speak of separately.</p>

<p>Not alone is the kauri monarch in the forests of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
New Zealand, but it must rank among the royallest
trees the earth produces. It grows, for the most
part, in forests sacred to itself, not mixing with the
common herd of trees. In this respect other kinds
of pine are similar. Also, each distinct tract of
kauri bush, or forest, contains trees of a certain
uniformity of age, consequently of size. In the
aggregate vast tracts are covered with it. The
largest forest of kauri is that between the Hokianga
and the Kaipara waters, which, I believe, is to be
put down at nearly a thousand square miles in
extent, bush of a more varied description intervening
here and there among it. After it come
the kauri forests of Mongonui, Whangaroa, and
Coromandel.</p>

<p>There are few experiences more impressive to
the feelings than to stand alone in the recesses of a
kauri forest. Unlike the character of the mixed
bush&mdash;the forest where trees of many other kinds are
found&mdash;the kauri bush is weirdly depressing from its
terrible monotony. It is solemn, sombre, and gloomy
to the last degree. Yet is there a profound majesty
about it that awes one in spite of oneself.</p>

<p>The trees stand closely together, not branching
out much till near the top. They cover range and
gully, mountain and plain, in unbroken succession.
At the base they may girth as much as up to fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
feet. Forty feet of girth is not uncommon, and
thirty feet is often the average. They soar up
straight to a hundred, a hundred and fifty, even
to a hundred and eighty feet before branching, and
then their leafy crowns, interlaced together, form
a canopy through which daylight hardly penetrates.</p>

<p>The boles of these woodland giants are mostly
black and smooth, sometimes covered with twigs,
though this chiefly in the smaller trees. Supple-jack,
bush-lawyer, mounga, various creeper-ferns
with magnificent fronds, and sometimes flowering
clematis, swing from trunk to trunk and knit the
columns together. Below there is not the thick
undergrowth that prevails in the varied bush, but a
lighter tangle of shrubs. Ferns, among which several
varieties like the maidenhair predominate, grow
waist-high in rank luxuriance.</p>

<p>The sublime grandeur of a kauri forest is hardly
equalled by anything else of the kind in nature. One
seems to stand amid the aisles of a mighty temple,
shut out from the world and imprisoned amid endless
ranks of tremendous columns. Stillness and
silence deepen the profundity of gloom around one.
The fiercest gale may be raging overhead, and not
a leaf is stirred within the dark coverts; only the
faint murmur of the foliage far above betrays what
is passing. Of life there is nothing visible. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
little fantails, the traveller's friends in the bush,
hover around one, and they are all one sees, unless
it be, perchance, the rapid flash of a rat running
up some trunk, or the scuttling of a kiwi or weka
amid the fern.</p>

<p>To get some real notion of what these forests
are like let us compare them with English woods.
The latter bear the palm of beauty, but the former
that of grandeur from their very vastness. The
largest wood in England is but the size of one
dingle in a kauri forest, and is flat and tame contrasted
with the hilly ruggedness of the land here.
Again, measure the girth of English beeches, oaks,
elms, and ashes. The oldest and best grown woods
will not give you an average girth of ten feet.
Trees girthing fifteen to twenty feet are rare and
singular. What is this to the giant kauri?</p>

<p>If we look at height there is another difference.
English trees are remarkable for their limbs and
branches. Take these away, and the stick that
remains seldom averages more than thirty or forty
feet. If it reaches to sixty the tree is regarded as
something extraordinary. But the splendid dome
of foliage, the beautiful spread of boughs, which is
the glory of English oak or chestnut, is forbidden
to the kauri. Its magnificence resides solely in its
stick, which is more like a factory chimney than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
anything else. You get an impression of immensity,
you feel a veritable pigmy as you walk, mile after
mile, among trees whose girth is thirty feet, and
whose branches only begin a hundred and thirty
feet from the ground; while, every now and then,
you come upon some patriarch of fifty feet girth
and a hundred and eighty feet, perhaps, of stick.</p>

<p>An assertion has been made, that if the present
rate of consumption be kept up, some eighty years
will see the end of the kauri forests. This may be
true, but I do not think it is. I fancy that it is
a calculation made in ignorance of the real extent
of the kauri bush. Also, that no true idea was
conceived of the enormous bulk of the trees, and
the countless number of them to be found far back
from the rivers, in the less accessible regions of the
bush. I think I might say, with quite as much
show of reason, that if the present rate of consumption
were even doubled, as it doubtless will
be, a century may elapse before economy in cutting
kauri need be studied.</p>

<p>When working with parties of the Government
Land Survey, I had good opportunities for getting
some idea of the stupendous supplies of kauri timber.
I once counted forty trees on a measured acre. Of
these the smallest had a girth of twenty feet, with
a stick of about eighty feet in height; the largest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
might be about double that. We estimated that
these trees would yield a million feet of sawn timber.
Of course that is an exceptional instance, but it must
be remembered that there are hundreds of square
miles of kauri bush in the aggregate.</p>

<p>The annual output of the saw-mills is reckoned to
be sixty million feet of sawn kauri timber, the value
of which may be roughly put at £300,000. Much of
this is used up in the colony; but an increasing
export trade, amounting in value to £40,000 or
£50,000 per annum, is carried on with Australia,
Fiji, and the South Sea Islands. There are some
twenty large saw-mills in various parts of the kauri
forests, and there are other small ones which supply
local demands; together these employ a large
number of hands.</p>

<p>The largest mill is that at Te Kopura, on the
Wairoa river, some forty-five miles above its outfall
into the Kaipara harbour. It can turn out 120,000
feet per week. At Aratapu, higher up the same
river, there is another mill, turning out 80,000 feet
per week. These mills are working on the outskirts
of the great Kaipara-Hokianga forest. Vessels
drawing seventeen feet of water can come up the
Wairoa to load at them. The mill at Whangaroa,
on the east coast, ranks next in point of size, turning
out sawn timber to the average annual value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
£23,000. At Whangapoua, in Coromandel, are two
mills, cutting about 160,000 feet per week between
them. The cost of their plant was £25,000. The
Whangapoua kauri bush extends over some 30,000
acres.</p>

<p>Sawn kauri is sold at the mills at 9<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> to
11<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per hundred feet. The high freights cause
it to cost 15<i>s.</i> to 17<i>s.</i> in the southern ports, and,
I believe, it is sold at about the same in Sydney or
the Islands. It would not be easy to say what is the
average yield of a tree, the difference being very
considerable. Some put it down at 10,000 feet,
but I am sure that is an under estimate.</p>

<p>A stick of fifty feet length, and thirty feet in
circumference at the base, might be reckoned to
yield about 20,000 feet of sawn timber. The value
of this would be £100. Deducting £40 as the
cost of felling, transporting to the mill, and cutting
up, a profit of £60 is left. This is a fair example.
When a stick of a hundred and fifty feet, with a
girth of forty or fifty feet, is in question, both work
and profit are larger, of course.</p>

<p>The stump of one of these titanic trees is no
small affair. It is big enough to build a small house
upon, if sawn flat. I remember once making one of
a party of eight, and dancing a quadrille on the
stump of a kauri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a variety of the tree known as the
mottled kauri. The wood of this is very curious
and beautiful, and fetches a high price for cabinet
work. It is not very common, and when a big tree
of this kind is come upon, it is a source of great
gratification to its owner, for it may yield him £500
or £600 of absolute profit.</p>

<p>Felling big trees with the axe is tremendous
labour. Till recently it was the only means employed
here. Perhaps you may have to cut five or six feet
deep into the tree, in order to reach the heart of it.
To do this an enormous gash must be made, so
large in fact, that scaffoldings have to be erected
within it, to permit the workmen to reach their mark.
Only two men can cut at the same gash at a time;
but frequent shifts are resorted to, so as to "keep
the pot boiling." Now, a saw working between
portable engines is more generally employed upon
the big trees.</p>

<p>When the great stick has been laid prostrate,
with a crash that resounds for miles, and a shock
that makes the whole hillside quiver, it is cut into
lengths, and roughly squared with long-handled
axes. Then comes the process of getting it to
the mill, which may possibly be a considerable
distance off.</p>

<p>The hilly and rugged character of the land nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
always prevents anything like a tramway system
being adopted; and, for a long time, trees were only
cut where they could be readily run down into the
water. But a system has been introduced, by an
American bushman, I believe, which is now generally
used, and by means of which the largest trees can
be got out anywhere in this country of heights and
hollows.</p>

<p>The logs are easily collected in the bottom of the
nearest gully, as they can be readily sent down the
sides of the ranges by means of screw-jacks, rollers
and slides. When the sides of the gully have been
denuded of their timber, and a huge collection of
logs lies piled in the bottom, preparation is made to
further their descent to the river. A dam is built
right across the ravine below the logs, constructed
of timber, earth, stones, and whatever material comes
handiest.</p>

<p>When the winter rains commence, the first day
or two of continued downpour causes every little
water-course to swell into a foaming torrent. The
stream in the gully pours down a great volume of
water, which, checked by the dam, spreads out
behind it into a broad lake that fills all the lower
ground. In this flood the mighty logs are borne up,
and float upon its surface.</p>

<p>The sides of the dam, which is angularly shaped,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
are chiefly supported by logs set up endways as
buttresses upon the lower side. To these supports
ropes are attached, which are carried up the hillsides
out of reach of the water, above the level of the
swollen flood pent in by the dam. Then men and
horses, or bullocks, haul with sudden and united
effort upon the ropes; the chief supports are torn
away; the dam breaks down in various places; the
waters overflow and stream through the breaches.
Or, sometimes, the dam is flushed by breaching
it with gunpowder or dynamite. Soon the mass
of water moves with irresistible force, breaking
down what is left of the dam and sweeping everything
before it. Then, in mighty volume, it rushes
down the gully, bearing onward with it the great
collection of massive logs that it has floated. Sometimes
the first flush carries the timber down to the
open river. Sometimes the entire process has to
be repeated more than once or twice, if the distance
be long, or the nature of the ground necessitate it.</p>

<p>When they fall into the river, or inlet of the sea,
as the case may be, the logs are brought up by
booms ready to receive them. They are then
chained together in rafts and floated down to the
mill, which, of course, gives upon the water-highway.
Often such a flush will constitute a whole year's
work, or longer; and will provide a supply of raw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
material for the saw-mill that will last it as long.
But exactly the same process may be practically and
profitably carried out for only a few logs, where the
gully is not large, and not too far from the river.</p>

<p>Our own special little community are pioneer
farmers, of course, and we do not employ ourselves
in this way. Still, some of us have in former years
acted the part of lumberers, or bushmen proper,
when we were working at any jobs that turned up.
The work we have is heavy enough in all conscience,
but it is light compared to the tremendous labour
that bushmen have to get through.</p>

<p>The lowest rate of wages for bushmen is 25<i>s.</i>
per week, and all found. But the rate varies, better
men getting better wages, the paucity of hands
affecting the scale, and strikes for more pay occurring
sometimes. I have known the hands of a saw-mill
to get as much as seven or nine shillings per day.</p>

<p>Usually there are comfortable barracks for the
men employed at a mill; but, when working up in
the bush, these are not always available, and the
workmen are lodged in huts, or shanties, upon the
ground, being in much the same case as we are in
our shanty. Their employers supply them with all
necessaries, and have to be pretty careful in this
respect, as your bushman will not work unless he
gets tucker according to a very liberal scale. Beef,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
mutton and pork, bread, potatoes, kumera and tea
he gets in unlimited quantities, besides various other
items that need not be catalogued.</p>

<p>Most of our produce is taken by the saw-mills at
the market-price. We have even sent them our fat
steers and wethers, instead of shipping them to
Auckland; and one year we made a good thing by
growing cabbages and fresh vegetables for the
bushmen. Like English colliers, they look to have
the best food going; and, what is more, they get it.
Yet it must be remembered that the bushman's
work is terribly hard. It needs the employment of
all the physical strength and vigour a man has to
bestow, and this must be used with a continued
pertinacity that is excessively trying.</p>

<p>Kauri-gum&mdash;or Kapia, as the Maoris call it&mdash;which
has been just alluded to, is another peculiar
product of this northern extremity of New Zealand.
It is not of any practical service to the colonists,
as the timber of the tree which produces it is,
but it is an export of considerably greater value.
It is the solidified sap, or resin of the kauri, but
not in a fresh form; it is that resin in a hardened
condition found buried in the ground.</p>

<p>There are tracts of country, known as gum-fields,
in which the kauri-gum is to be dug up most
plentifully. These places are stretches of bleak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
moorland for the most part, though not invariably.
The soil in them consists very much of a heavy
yellow clay, loose and friable near the surface. It
is impregnated with fragments and particles of gum,
which may be found in numerous spots to occur in
layers and collections of larger pieces, varying in
size up to blocks the size of a man's body. It is not
usual to collect pieces smaller than the closed fist&mdash;minuter
fragments not being considered remunerative
to the digger.</p>

<p>The gum is found just below the surface of the
ground, and sometimes down to the depth of six or
eight feet. The finding of it, collecting and bringing
to market, affords a sufficiently profitable occupation
to have constituted a distinct class of men, who go
by the name of gum-diggers.</p>

<p>Gum-fields are poor lands usually, though some
are adapted for settlement. The country lying
between Riverhead, Helensville, and Ararimu,
which I described when relating our journey up-country,
is a fair example of a gum-field. But gum
is also found in the kauri forests, round the roots of
the trees, especially of old, partly decayed, or wholly
dead specimens. It is also to be found pretty
generally throughout all the land of the kauri. Of
course it cannot be discovered everywhere, or in all
soils, but traces of it will be apparent somewhere in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
any single square mile; and in every sort of land
throughout the limit of the kauri's growth, gum will
be found here and there. Thus, on our farm and
in the surrounding bush, although these are distinctly
not gum-lands, there are little patches of ground, of
a few acres in extent, whence we have got a ton or
two of gum at times.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark that the fresh resin of the
living trees is not of any commercial value. Great
masses of gum are often found in forks and clefts of
the trees, and about the roots; but of this, only a
little of the latter is generally worth anything, the
rest being soft and in a condition that renders it
valueless. It seems that the gum must be buried
underground for a considerable time, an unknown
term of years, before it attains the degree of hardness
and other qualities that merchants require.</p>

<p>I have been told that the Maoris collect the soft,
fresh gum and bury it, so that they or their descendants
may dig it up again after sufficient time has
elapsed for it to undergo the requisite changes.
Whether this is so or not I am unable to say of my
personal knowledge. I have never met with any
instance of the kind, and have strong doubts as to
the forecasting care with which such a tale credits
the Maoris. They are certainly not given to providing
for a distant future in a general way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>It would seem that the deposits of gum in the
soil are all that remains of ancient kauri forests.
These must once have covered the open fern-lands,
where no trace of them now remains, except rich
gum-holes here and there. It would seem that the
kauri had, in the course of ages, exhausted the soil
on which they grew, of constituents necessary to
their growth, and had then naturally died out in
such localities. The existing forests are, of course,
making new deposits, which will some day be
available. Felling the trees necessarily causes a
diminution of this, but possibly some means may
yet be discovered of rendering the fresh, soft gum
equally useful with the semi-fossil kind.</p>

<p>Kauri-gum is very like amber in general appearance,
and is similar to it in chemical characteristics;
but it is much more brittle, and hence is not of such
value for ornaments. Many colonists amuse themselves
with carving and polishing trinkets of gum,
but they chip too readily to permit of their ever
being of value. Kauri-gum has sometimes been
fraudulently substituted for amber, but the better
specimens of the latter have a yellow tint which is
seldom seen in the New Zealand product. Our
gum exists of various shades of brown and sherry-colour,
both clear and clouded. The most highly-prized
variety is colourless like glass, or nearly so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
and some is found almost black, not unlike jet.
Flies, fragments of moss, and so on, are occasionally
seen embedded in it.</p>

<p>Kauri-gum was first brought into notice at the
time of the first colonization, in 1840 and 1841. It
was then collected chiefly by Maoris, and was sold
by them to the store-keepers. Its value at that time
was only £5 or £6 per ton; and about a hundred
tons was all the annual export for some years.</p>

<p>Since then, however, an increasing demand for
it arose in the United States. New York and
Boston now take two-thirds of all the gum exported;
and of what is sent home to England the greater
part is re-shipped thence to American ports. The
number of gum-diggers regularly employed is supposed
to have exceeded four thousand at times;
now they average some two thousand altogether.
The amount of the export steadily increased from
the first, until, in 1870-71-72, it reached to some
fifteen thousand tons for the three years, valued at
half a million sterling.</p>

<p>Subsequent to this there was very considerable
falling off in the export. The number of diggers
decreased, fields were declared worked out, and it
was thought that the supplies were exhausted. But
after a year or two, it was discovered that gum
existed in many places where its presence had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
hitherto unsuspected; and it was also made clear
that large deposits were often underlying the two or
three feet of surface-soil previously worked, on the
fields it was thought were exhausted.</p>

<p>A fresh impulse was given to gum-digging, and
the amount of the export rose again. In 1878, it
stood at 3410 tons; in 1879, at 3247 tons; in 1880,
as much as 5500 tons was shipped, valued at £236,500.
From 1853 to 1880 inclusive, about 70,000 tons
were sent out, export value £2,100,000. It would
thus seem that kauri-gum is more plentiful now
than ever, while its average value has risen to £43
per ton.</p>

<p>Some American scientist has given it as his
opinion that the kauri-gum exported from 1840 to
1880 must have required a forest-growth of ten
thousand years to have produced it; but then we
know that scientists will go making these rash
assertions on the very vaguest premises. How long
ago the kauri forests that covered the now open
fern-lands died out, it would be hard to say. And
how long they had stood before that is an equally
difficult problem to solve. Of the trees in the
forests now standing we can easily calculate the age.
Some of them were already big trees at the period
when Julius Cæsar was colonizing the other Britain.
Doubtless the forests here were pretty much what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
they are to-day, when Norman and Saxon and
Dane were fighting for the throne.</p>

<p>Gum-diggers receive an all-round price for the
gum they bring down to the stores, which fluctuates
somewhat in amount. It usually averages about
£30 a ton. Before reaching its final market, the
gum is cleaned, picked, and carefully assorted and
re-assorted into six or eight different classes. The
very best of these has been known to sell at £144
per ton in New York; the others at varying prices
down to £25 or £20 for the lowest class. The
average price is now £43 per ton.</p>

<p>The use to which kauri-gum is put is the manufacture
of varnish. At least this is the general
theory. It is made into a varnish much resembling
that of copal; and gum copal, as the reader will
remember, is the product of the <i>Hymenea verrucosa</i>
of tropical Eastern Africa, where it is dug from the
ground much as kauri-gum is here.</p>

<p>Varnish-making is the assigned use of kauri-gum,
but there is a dark suspicion afloat in our Brighter
Britain that this is not the only nor the chief one.
It is hinted that the Yankees use it to adulterate
something or other with, or to fix up some compound
of a wholly different kind. I will not say that
O'Gaygun is solely responsible for this insinuation,
but he certainly fosters it in every way he can.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mind of our Milesian ally there exists a
profound belief that the principal object in life of an
American is to invent new and profitable ways of
adulteration, or to discover means of perfecting
colossal shams, and thereby defrauding a guileless
public, such as ourselves.</p>

<p>For my own part, I disagree with O'Gaygun on
this point. Experience has led me to believe that
the English manufacturer and trader stand unrivalled
in all the arts of adulteration. The Yankee is a
babe compared to them at this game. In fact, so
far as exports are concerned, it would seem as if the
British merchant could not help a greater or lesser
measure of chicanery. What the Yankee sends to
us is generally good; this in other matters besides
hardware.</p>

<p>But O'Gaygun's views are warped, and his
conclusions are mainly drawn from the remembrance
of one incident, the tale of which he is never weary
of narrating.</p>

<p>It seems that, shortly before he came out to
New Zealand, O'Gaygun was concerned with others
in the exportation from Ireland to America of a
certain mineral. It was a heavy, white, glistening
earth, which I take to have been witherite, or
carbonate of baryta.</p>

<p>This stuff was sold ostensibly for paint-making,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and certain Yankee merchants bought up all they
could of it. Shipload after shipload went to America,
and the Irish speculators were in high glee as the
demand for it increased; although such a quantity
had been shipped as would have sufficed to have
whitewashed the entire two continents.</p>

<p>At last the real destination of the mineral came
to light. It was powdered and mixed with flour,
which America was then exporting largely to Europe.
It made the finest flours heavier, and made seconds
rank as first-class. So, according to O'Gaygun,
hundreds and thousands of tons of this witherite
were eaten by cheated Europe in the form of bread.
A whole mountain, so he says, was shipped to the
land of the Stars and Stripes; and as much as was
sent came back to Europe as flour.</p>

<p>When the thing was blown upon, of course, the
export gradually ceased. And I believe that
O'Gaygun and his associates were blamed for
participation in the fraud. Therefore he, poor,
deluded Irishman, has ever since held the Yankee
to be of very nature iniquitous in all his dealings.
Well, let us hope that kauri-gum is, after all, only an
innocent varnish basis, as is generally stated, and
that it is not eaten as pork or beans or anything
by a too-confiding British public.</p>

<p>The gum-diggers of Northern New Zealand are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
a peculiar body of nomads. They are recruited
from every nation, and from every rank of society,
and, like the communities gathered together on
Australian or Californian gold-fields, present a
strange medley of opposites.</p>

<p>Among them one may come across men who
are graduates of the universities. One may find
members of noble houses, representatives of historic
names; nay, twice I have met men born to titles
gum-digging. Then one may find diggers who
should belong to professions they have abandoned&mdash;civil,
military, learned, artistic. Clerks, accountants,
secretaries, and shopmen swell the ranks of our
Bohemian army. There are guileless peasants,
natives of Norfolk or Devon, France or Germany,
perhaps; and there are runaway sailors, ex-convicts,
tinkers, tailors, printers' devils, pirates, rowdies,
negroes, Kanakas, Maoris, Chinamen; a collection
of gentlemen educated to every pursuit under the
sun, in fact.</p>

<p>Throughout all this heterogeneous assemblage
there exists entire equality, but little fraternization.
Each man is as good as his fellow; there is no
recognized line of demarcation between man and
man. Yet gum-diggers are not gregarious as a rule;
they are too jealous, each of another's possible luck,
to admit of general brotherhood. Generally little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
gangs associate together and work in company; but
it is rare that they do so on communistic principles.
More often, each member of the gang works entirely
for his own hand, though they may have food and
so on in common.</p>

<p>There is precious little feeling of <i>caste</i>, or prejudice
on account of different social ranks, remaining to us
in this free land. What there is, however, places
gum-diggers, as a class, on the bottommost level of
society. Not that even that distinction conveys any
slight upon individual gum-diggers; it is more a
sort of abstract principle, than anything real or
practical.</p>

<p>Still, they are sneered at occasionally by other
colonists. It is a favourite theory that, if you should
see some particularly haughty swell come out with
all the pomp of a first-class passage, some grandiose
creature of the scapegrace-fine-gentleman sort, with
such airs and dignity as befit a man who feels that
the colony was made for him, and not he for the
colony, you may chuckle over his probable descent
to gum-digging very soon. You have to get out of
his lordly path while the air of the quarter-deck is
round him, feeling that this humble country is only
too much honoured by his mere presence in it.
But, in a few months' time, you come across him on
the gum-field, in ankle-jacks and ragged shirt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
picking up a scanty living. He is Captain Gorgeous
Dashabout no longer.</p>

<p>There is a certain charm about gum-digging,
particularly to people of unsettled and gypsy-like
disposition. You have no boss. You can do as
you like; work when you like, and how you like;
and lie on your back when it pleases you to do so,
without fear of being rowed at by any one. Moreover,
with ordinary luck, you can make as good
wages as by working on a farm, and that with less
actual toil, though possibly some additional hardship.</p>

<p>Gum-diggers must be equipped as lightly as
possible. It is commonly said that a blanket, a
spade, a gum-spear, a knife, a hatchet, a billy, a pipe,
some provisions and tobacco, together with the
clothes he stands in, constitute all that a gum-digger
needs in the way of outfit. He really cannot afford
to possess much more, for he must hump all his
belongings on his own back, over mountain and
dale, forest and morass. This is one reason why
small parties associate together, besides for company.
They can then manage to carry a better sufficiency
of things with them from camp to camp.</p>

<p>Where proximity to a settlement, a road, or a
river permits of it, it is possible for gum-diggers to
make their camps pretty comfortable. Often it is
not necessary to move camp for months at a time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
when the surrounding field is pretty rich in gum-holes.
But they are not a provident class, seldom
caring for anything beyond the present moment.</p>

<p>The occupation is simplicity itself. Once the
prospecting has been accomplished and the district
determined on, the party move to it as best they
can. Nearly always there is a long tramp through
the wilds, with the necessaries on back and shoulders.
Then a camp is formed in some favourable spot
near a stream; a rude hut is constructed of such
material as is at hand; and a store of firewood is cut.</p>

<p>For work, each man straggles about all day by
himself, with his spear and spade and sack. He
tries every likely looking place with the spear, which
is simply an iron rod, sharp at one end, and with a
wooden handle at the other. When the end of
the spear touches buried gum, there is a peculiar clip
or "feel," which the digger knows. Then he digs
out the gum, fills his sack, and carries it to camp,
continuing to work the same spot as long as it yields
anything, when he goes on to look for another. In
the evenings he scrapes and cleans the day's take
with his knife.</p>

<p>Sometimes a digger will not get a shilling's
worth of gum in a whole week's work; sometimes
he will find five or six pounds' worth in an hour.
Generally speaking, and taking one week with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
another, he may earn £2 to £4 a week. When
enough has been collected and scraped it is carried
down to the nearest bush-store or settlement, where
it is at once sold. Provisions are bought, and the
surplus may be banked, though, in nine cases out of
ten, it goes in a "lush up." Some gum-diggers
save till they can get down to Auckland, and then
they have a high old time of it as long as the
money lasts.</p>

<p>It will be seen how this kind of life appeals to
the ne'er-do-well. Luck and chance are elements in
it; and it is a free, roving, devil-may-care existence.
Hence it is that scapegraces take to it so kindly,
and prefer its risks and manifest hardships to the
steady work of farm-labourers or bushmen.</p>

<p>Gum-diggers seldom make much money. They
get a living, and that is about all. Now and then
they may do better, but it only results in a "burst."
Yet gum-digging has often been a great assistance
to settlers. We have taken to it at times, in order
to raise a little ready money, when the farm was not
paying. Many a small, needy settler has found it
a resource to stave off ruin. To energetic and industrious
men it offers good wages on the whole,
and, as a temporary thing, many such have taken
advantage of it.</p>

<p>There are even men among the regular gum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>-diggers
who are superior to their class. These may
save all they make, till they have enough to start a
small pioneer-farm, or to set up in some handicraft.
Thus, in spite of the acknowledged evil repute of
the gum-digger, there will be and are, in our Brighter
Britain, comfortable homes, whose proprietors will
tell you that they are founded and built upon kauri-gum,
so to speak.</p>

<small>OUR CLASSIC GROUND.</small></h2>


<p>When the history of New Zealand comes to be
written, and when a new generation finds time to
look back upon the country's past, that also having
grown with the coming years, a new want will imperceptibly
arise. A desire will develop in people's
minds for something to reverence. Out of the
crudest materials will be erected monuments to the
past, and the older these become the more they will
be esteemed, while the events they speak of will
come to be regarded as of greater and greater importance.
So it has been with England; so it has
been in America; so it will be in Australia and
New Zealand. Nay, already the first symptoms of
the feeling are beginning to appear among us.</p>

<p>America has gathered all the force of sacred
memories round Plymouth Rock and Bunker Hill,
Manhattan and Yorktown, and other places commemorative
of the crises, or romantic episodes, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
her history. So, in like manner, shall our descendants
find spots connected with the long ago, whose
tales shall serve to quicken the glow of patriotic
sentiment in their hearts.</p>

<p>Laugh, reader, if you like. The early events of
our history seem so trivial to you now. You cannot
get up any enthusiasm about them, anyhow. Yet
future generations will have another and more
generous feeling. A time will come when crowds of
tourists, guide-book in hand, will rush from southern
cities to "do" those quiet places that now seem
utterly forgotten. Take my word for it; that of a
man who never romanced!</p>

<p>Probably there will be spots of more or less
renown scattered up and down throughout all the
country. But the region destined to be most widely
known and justly celebrated, held in high regard
from its wealth of associations with the earliest days
of our history, and esteemed not lightly either for its
natural scenery, is that comprised within the three
counties of Bay of Islands, Mongonui, and Hokianga.
Already, even, this is worthy to be named the classic
ground of New Zealand.</p>

<p>Some of our little community in the Kaipara go
up into the Bay not infrequently. We have good
friends living up in that part, and we go on pleasure
as well as on business. Dandy Jack is up there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
oftenest of any, for he does some trade in those
districts in horses and cattle. One or two of us
go to help him, and we have, on certain occasions,
joined land-surveying expeditions, whose head-quarters
were in the Bay. So that, on the whole, we know
the three counties tolerably well.</p>

<p>Our route from here lies through the Maungaturoto
bush, and up to Mangapai and Whangarei, a
distance of forty-and-odd miles. Beyond that is
another stretch of about the same distance, before the
Kawakawa is reached. The greater part of the way
lies through dense forest, but there is a track along
which it is possible to ride. This is called a road in
these parts, but as the most experienced bushman is
apt to lose it altogether on occasions, its actual
character may be guessed. I believe Dandy Jack
did once accomplish the whole journey to the Kawa-kawa
in two days. As a rule, however, it takes us
four. The nature of the track is not adapted for
quick riding, so that twenty or twenty-five miles is
about as much as we can make in the day.</p>

<p>We have to camp out at nights, of course, except
the one night we put up at Whangarei, but this is
no uncommon experience for us. There are some
creeks to be crossed that are rather ugly when full
of water; one or two must be swum sometimes.
It is a fearful and arduous job to bring cattle along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
this road, as might be expected. Some are pretty
sure to be lost out of the drove, while some will get
stuck in the mud of marshes and crossings, and a
rare job it is to extricate them.</p>

<p>Once we had a pack-horse with us, laden with
stores and utensils for a surveyor's camp. He was
led with a rope as we rode. Just at one of the
worst parts he broke away and bolted, kicking and
bucking as he went, the result being that the baggage
went flying in all directions. It took us half a
day or more to recapture the horse, and to pick up
his scattered load. This will serve to illustrate some
of the pleasing incidents of travel in the bush.</p>

<p>On one occasion Old Colonial, Dandy Jack, and
I were camped somewhere beyond Whangarei. We
were making the journey up to fetch down some
cattle. We were in a little dingle beside a small
stream. The huge fire was blazing merrily in front,
lighting up the tree-trunks with weird effect, and
making the shadows of the forest round us seem
more profound. Near by our horses were tethered,
and we lay, now our supper was done, rolled in our
blankets, pipes in mouth, and heads pillowed on our
saddles.</p>

<p>We were talking of some improvements that had
been recently effected in the settlements, and from
that we got to speculating on the future. Dandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Jack was wearily sighing for the good time when
there should be a decent road constructed along
this route.</p>

<p>"Wonder whether I shall live to see it;" he said.</p>

<p>"Of course you will," replied Old Colonial, who
is nothing if not optimistic in his views.</p>

<p>"I tell you what; we shall all live to see not only
a good road through this, but farms and settlements
and hotels along it!"</p>

<p>"Bravo!" returned Dandy Jack. "Then I'll
start a coach to run from Kawa-kawa to Whangarei,
and on to Mangawai, or across to Te Pahi, perhaps.
Might pick up some trade, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"I reckon your coach would be a failure, old
man," continued Old Colonial. "I expect to see a
railway one of these days, connecting Auckland with
the Bay, and all the places between. Not much
room for your coach then!"</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll not make a railroad up here this
century."</p>

<p>"I expect they will, though," said our chief, impressively.</p>

<p>"And, look here! I'll tell you what's going to
help make business for it. The Bay and Hokianga
are our classic ground."</p>

<p>"Classic ground?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Here are the places where Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Cook came, and Tasman, and all the early voyagers.
Here's where the first missionaries came; where
colonization commenced; where British sovereignty
was established. Here's where the history of the
early days has got to be written. Here's where
Hongi lived, and Hone Heke after him; where the
first Maori war was fought; where battles were
won, and pas stormed, and treaties signed. This is
the most illustrious district in the whole colony.
Whatever memories we've got date from here. I
tell you that streams of tourists will want to come
and see these places some day. We ought to make
more of them now than we do."</p>

<p>So rhapsodized Old Colonial, after a manner that
occasionally affects him, while the forest gleamed
redly round us with the reflection of our camp-fire,
and a bittern boomed in mockery and remonstrance
from a neighbouring swamp. I heard Dandy Jack
softly murmuring to the trees&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
 <div class="verse">"Meet nurse for a poetic child;</div>
 <div class="verse">Land of brown heath and shaggy wood!</div>
 <div class="verse">Land of the mountain and the flood!"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>And when Old Colonial attempted to continue&mdash;</p>

<p>"If this isn't classic ground, what is, I should
like to know? Posterity will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dandy Jack cut him short with a loud declamation
from "Locksley Hall." But I remembered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
allusion to classic ground, in spite of our merriment
at the time, and, accordingly, it finds effect in this
chapter.</p>

<p>The little settlement of Mangapai is much like
those we are accustomed to in the Kaipara. It is
situated on a creek and inlet of the Whangarei
Harbour. But the township of Whangarei itself,
some eight miles further north, is in a considerably
more advanced stage than anything we can
show.</p>

<p>The harbour is something like our Kaipara, only
of less extent. It is a considerable inlet of the sea,
with Heads at the entrance, some tidal rivers, and
creeks navigable for a short distance. There is direct
communication by sea with Auckland, kept up by
means of sundry schooners and sailing-craft. The
large steamer <i>Iona</i>, which plies between Auckland,
Bay of Islands, and Mongonui every week, calls at
Whangarei Heads on each trip for passengers. A
small steamer plies within the harbour itself.</p>

<p>Whangarei township is a remarkably favourable
specimen of a bush settlement. It stands on a
river, and is about seventeen miles distant from the
Heads. The little town occupies a flat, rendered
very picturesque by the gardens about the houses,
and by a surrounding amphitheatre of bush-clothed
heights. There is a church, hotels, stores, schools,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
mills, streets and roads, even a local newspaper, to
bear evidence to the energy and prosperity of the
settlers.</p>

<p>The district round about the Whangarei waters
is rich soil for the most part, mainly covered with
bush in its natural condition. Settlement took place
here a good many years before it was begun in the
Kaipara, consequently more improvement has been
effected. The pioneer farms and homesteads show a
surprising amount of comfort. They have lots of
grass for pasturage, and two or three thousand acres
of plough-lands in the aggregate as well.</p>

<p>Then there are two special industries in the
place. One is lime-burning, the product being sent
to supply Auckland demands for it. The other is
coal-mining. A mine was opened here some years
ago, and was afterwards flooded and consequently
closed, remaining unworked for some time. It has
now again been re-opened, and is in full swing of
work, though the operations are only carried out in
a small way comparatively.</p>

<p>One would think that the road, so called, connecting
two settlements of such relative importance
as Whangarei and Kawa-kawa, would be a better one
than it is. The distance is between forty and fifty
miles, and there is no settlement between. The road
is just a track, along which it is possible to ride and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
drive cattle. A good part of the way lies through
heavy bush.</p>

<p>But there is really very little traffic between
these places, and what there is can be best transacted
by sea. It is the general fashion in a country like
this. Each settlement requires water-communication
with Auckland, and cares little at present for anything
else. A settler makes a road down to the
river, or to the settlement on the river, sufficient for
his own purposes, and as short as possible. That is
all he particularly wants. The necessity for roads
between settlements, and to open up the back-country,
only grows gradually with time. Of course
in other parts of the colony, where there is not water
everywhere as in the North, the case is widely
different. A good road or a railway is the first and
chief thing needed there.</p>

<p>At Kawa-kawa we are in the Bay of Islands, and
consequently within the classic ground. Indeed,
south-east of Kawa-kawa is the site of the famous
pa of Ruapekapeka, which was a strong native
fortress, constructed with a degree of skill, and science
almost, that astonished military engineers.</p>

<p>The Kawa-kawa river gives its name to the
district. There is a good deal of settlement and
pioneer-farming round here and in Pakaru district,
but the chief industry of the place is coal-mining.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
A hundred to a hundred and fifty colliery hands
are employed, forming, with their families, a good
nucleus of population. Manganese and cement are
also mined here.</p>

<p>The seam is twelve and a half feet thick; and
the output about three thousand tons a month.
There are some half-dozen miles of railway, connecting
the mine with a suitable shipping-place, near
where the river joins the waters of the bay itself.
A fleet of coasters is constantly employed carrying
coal to Grahamstown and Auckland. Extensive
coal-beds exist in many parts of the North, but
Whangarei and Kawa-kawa are the only workings
at present. I have seen some carbonized cocoa-nuts
extracted from the Kawa-kawa mine, which
prove that the cocoa-nut palm must once have
grown here, though it does not now.</p>

<p>There is nothing particularly classic about a
colliery village, however, although it may be situated
in a primeval solitude, and amid woodland scenery,
where axe and spade are busy converting the
wilds into cultivated farms. The river winds down
through grand mountainous tracts, and then we
find ourselves on the bosom of the gloriously beautiful
bay, the most picturesque and most romantic
of all places in the North&mdash;more, the home of the
first chapters of our history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>I will not go so far as to say that the Bay of
Islands is as lovely as Sydney Harbour, nor can
I allow that it throws certain choice bits of scenery
in the Kaipara and the Hokianga estuaries entirely
into the shade. But it certainly is a most picturesque
place. The views are so varied, so wholly
unique; and the stories connected with every corner
of the bay throw such a romantic halo over the
whole, that I feel quite justified in endorsing the
opinion that the Bay of Islands is, and always must
be, the most remarkable place in Northern New
Zealand.</p>

<p>The entrance of the bay is guarded by two great
rocky headlands, Cape Wiwiki and Cape Brett.
These stand some twelve miles apart, and the
distance from them to the back of the bay is about
twenty miles. But numerous inlets open up into
the land, and four considerable creeks, the Keri-keri,
Waitangi, Kawa-kawa, and Waitari fall into the
bay, forming large estuaries at their junction with
it. The promontories, headlands, and indentations
of the shores, together with the hundred islands and
islets that thickly stud the waters, diversify the
scenery very much, and cause you to think, as you
sail or row between them, that you are gliding from
river into river and from channel into channel, with
broad lake-like reaches interspersed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>About fifteen miles from Cape Brett, and on
the same side of the bay, a promontory of considerable
size juts out. Upon the inner side of this
stands Kororareka, capital of the Bay, and its port
of entry.</p>

<p>Officialism has recently been trying very hard to
alter the name of this place into Russell, which
action is much deprecated by settlers, who insist
upon retaining the old native name. The reason
for the proposed change is not very clear, and why
this particular town should have been so singled
out is equally inexplicable to the unofficial mind.
It seems to be a great pity, in any case, to bestow
such names as Smithville, or Russell, or New
London upon growing settlements, the future cities
of a future nation. It is a pity because they are
not distinctive, nor expressive of the country upon
which they are grafted. How much better to retain
the old native names, which carry with them sound
and meaning both original and peculiar. Educated
Americans are beginning to find this out, and to
regret the loss of an indigenous character, which
springs from the vulgarity and confusion of their
nomenclature. How much better are such names
as Pensacola or Tallahassee, than New Orleans or
New York?</p>

<p>In New Zealand native names have been very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
largely retained, though less so in the south than
in the north. But jacks in office are for ever trying
to perpetuate their own names, or those of individuals
whom they toady, by making them do duty
for towns or counties or rivers. It is a "vulgarian
atrocity," similar to that which moves a cockney
soul to scratch its ignoble appellative upon pyramid
or monolith.</p>

<p>In this particular instance, it is a positive shame
to hurl such an insulting degradation into our classic
ground. Kororareka, under that name, is the oldest
settlement in the colony. It is intimately associated
with early history. Kororareka&mdash;"The Beach of
Shells"&mdash;was once a native kainga. Then it became
a whaling station, and earned notoriety as a piratical
stronghold, and the pandemonium of the Pacific.
From that it was erected into the first capital of
the colony, metropolis and seat of government for
all New Zealand, under Mr. Busby, the British
resident, and, in 1840, Captain Hobson, the first
governor. It was plundered and burnt by Heke
and Kawiti, and was a central point of the first
Maori war.</p>

<p>Kororareka is a quiet little village now, and is
never likely to grow into much more, unless it should
become a manufacturing centre. Other places must
take the trade of the district eventually. Hence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
Kororareka will always rest its chief claim to note
upon its past history; so to call it Russell is to
spoil its little romance. It is an outrageous vandalism,
a nonsensical piece of spite or idiotcy that,
in a philological and sentimental sense, is almost to
be regarded as a crime.</p>

<p>As you come into sight of Kororareka from the
bay, you are favourably impressed by its appearance.
The town stands upon a wide flat, bordered by a
high beach of white shingle and shells, from the
centre of which a large wharf runs out for shipping
to come alongside. A street of houses, stores and
hotels principally, faces the beach, and gives the
place all the airs of a miniature Brighton or Margate.
Some other straggling streets run back from this.</p>

<p>The background is a low grassy range, evidently
farm-lands. This range shuts out all view of the
bay on the other side of the promontory. To the
right it merges into the mountain tract that sentinels
the Waitari and Kawa-kawa estuaries. On the left
rises an abrupt and wooded hill, fissured with many
romantic little glens and hollows. From this eminence,
to which a road winds up from the town through
the woods, a most magnificent view is obtainable.
A great part of the panorama of this island-studded
harbour lies stretched below one's feet; and on the
highest crest is a certain famous flagstaff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>Kororareka is not very large. The resident
population is probably not more than two or three
hundred. Farming industry round it is comparatively
small. Its communication overland with
other places is not good, and the hilly character of
the contiguous land presents great difficulties in the
way of the formation of roads. The place depends
on its harbour, which is much used by whalers, who
come here to tranship or sell oil, and to take in
supplies. Quiet and dead-alive as it seems in
general, there are times when a number of vessels
are assembled here, and when bustle and business
is consequently pretty brisk.</p>

<p>Before settled government and colonization overtook
New Zealand, this spot had achieved an unsavoury
reputation. Originally a native town, it
had gradually become the resort of whaling-ships.
Traders established themselves here, and a rowdy
population of runaway sailors, ex-convicts, bad
characters, and debauched Maoris filled the place.
Drunkenness and riot were the general order of
things; and it was even said that Kororareka was
developing into a nest of pirates. There was no
sort of government to restrain the evil, and man's
passions, as usual, were transforming a natural Eden
into a moral hell.</p>

<p>During these days of anarchy there is no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
that Kororareka was a sad thorn in the side to the
missionaries, who were achieving wonderful results
among the native tribes. The wanton profligacy
of whites in Kororareka infected their converts, and
interfered sadly with the Christianizing of the Maoris.
Moreover, other places of a like nature began to
spring up here and there on the coasts.</p>

<p>One would have thought that sober, God-fearing
men would have hailed the establishment of British
government, and would have done much to further
colonization. Such, however, was far from being
the idea or action of the early missionaries. So far
as the missionaries in New Zealand were themselves
concerned, they would seem to have turned a very
cold shoulder to such of their countrymen as
adventured thither, independently of the missions.
So we are informed by one or two travellers who
visited the country between 1814 and 1840. Nor
is this feeling at all to be wondered at, considering
the class of men who came to Kororareka. The
European adventurers who came to New Zealand
then were so generally of a loose and lawless order,
that it is scarcely matter for surprise that missionaries
should have looked askance at every white
man they saw.</p>

<p>This feeling spread to the Societies at home
in England, and was, doubtless, much exaggerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
among their more zealous, but less large-minded
supporters. It became mingled with a desire to
preserve New Zealand for its aboriginal race; to
convert and civilize that people; and to foster their
self-government under the direct influence of the
missionaries. And it must be borne in mind that
the missionaries were really unacquainted with the
extent of the country, and with the actual number
of its native inhabitants; while people in England
had very vague ideas regarding their antipodes.</p>

<p>A party was formed in England, which has been
styled "the Exeter Hall party." The persons
adhering to its views did all in their power to
prevent English colonization, or English government
being established in New Zealand. The
merits of the question as between them and their
opponents need not concern us now.</p>

<p>The existence of such a place as Kororareka was
felt to be a curse to the whole of the South Sea, and
did not fail to affect even Sydney, two thousand
miles away. There were not wanting some to press
upon the Imperial Government the necessity of
annexation and of active steps being taken. The
Exeter Hall party, however, frustrated their endeavours,
actuated thereto by motives that time
has shown to have been founded on miscomprehension
and mistake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Guided by the Exeter Hall influence, and by
representations made by the missionaries, the Imperial
Government took a decided step in 1835. They
recognized New Zealand as independent, treated
with a confederation of Maori chiefs, and bestowed
a national flag upon the country, thus forfeiting the
claim acquired from Captain Cook's original discovery.
Mr. Busby was appointed to be British
resident at Kororareka; as, however, he had no
force to act with, he was unable to preserve order
in that place, and he had neither influence nor power
wherewith to uphold the dignity of his office and of
the country he represented.</p>

<p>Persons in England who had been desirous of
seeing New Zealand converted into an appanage
of the British crown, covered their disappointment
by forming an association, styled "The New Zealand
Company," much upon the basis of the old East
Indian Company. They proceeded to form settlements
upon a system of their own; a pioneering
expedition being sent out in 1839, and the first body
of emigrants landing at Port Nicholson in 1840.
Their action, together with the outcry caused by
the condition of things at Kororareka, caused the
Imperial Government to reverse its former policy.</p>

<p>Another circumstance operated to hasten the
Government's decision. French Roman Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
missions had been established in New Zealand, and
were gaining many converts among the Maoris.
In 1837 a French nobleman, one Baron de Thierry,
purchased a large area in Hokianga, and sought to
establish himself there as a sovereign prince. Then
the French Government prepared to annex the
islands as a possession of France.</p>

<p>In January, 1840, Captain Hobson arrived at
Kororareka in command of H.M.S <i>Rattlesnake</i>, instructed
to hoist the British standard, which he only
succeeded in doing a few hours before a French ship
arrived for a similar purpose. Captain Hobson at
once found a staunch ally in the person of Tamati
Waka, a powerful Ngapuhi chief. By this man's
influence the Christianized chiefs of the North were
gathered together, and induced to sign the famous
Treaty of Waitangi, on March 5, 1840. That instrument
is the title-deed of the colony. It was
the formal cession of sovereignty to Queen Victoria,
by the principal men of the Maori nation.</p>

<p>The missionaries have been severely criticized
for the policy and line of action adopted by them,
and by the Exeter Hall party at home. Doubtless
much might be said on either side, were it in any
way desirable to reopen a somewhat bitter controversy.
One thing is certain, that nowhere, and at
no time, have missionaries of the Church of Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>land,
and of the Wesleyan body, found their labours
followed by more signal success than in New
Zealand; and the zeal, fortitude, and high-souled
devotion of the pioneers of the gospel in our
Brighter Britain, must surely win the admiration of
even the enemies of Christianity.</p>

<p>Not far from Cape Wiwiki, on the northern
shore of the Bay of Islands, and half a day's sail
away from Kororareka, is a spot of great interest.
Sheltered within high craggy headlands, and shut
out from the open bay by a rocky and bush-clothed
island, is a bright and peaceful little cove. There
are but few signs of life here; the place looks
almost deserted. A couple of houses are visible,
divided by rising ground; and a farm lies round
them, bounded by hills wearing the evergreen
verdure of the forest.</p>

<p>Walking about this farm, you perceive that it is
not of very great extent&mdash;a hundred acres or so,
probably. But you are at once struck with something
that is strange to you, after the pioneer homesteads
of the Kaipara. The turf is old and smooth,
the fields are drained and level, the ditches are
embanked, the hedges full-grown and thick, the
imported trees are in maturity. Everything denotes
that this is no new clearing. Abundant evidence
is all around to testify to the truth of what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
hospitable farmer will tell you, namely, that the
cultivation here is sixty years old.</p>

<p>This place is Te Puna, ever to be renowned as
the site of the first mission, established here by the
Rev. Samuel Marsden, in 1814.</p>

<p>The incentives those early missionaries had to
go to New Zealand were certainly not of an engaging
kind. They knew that the natives were a
fierce and bloodthirsty set of savages, that they
were constantly at war among themselves, and were
addicted to cannibalism. Although some few individuals
had visited Sydney, and seemed tractable
enough, assuring Mr. Marsden of their good will
and power to protect missionaries, yet there was no
sort of certainty. The Maoris were known to be
badly disposed to strangers, on the whole, and many
stories of their treachery were current. Since
Marion du Fresne, with fifteen men, was killed by
Maoris in the Bay of Islands, there had been various
instances of a similar kind. Only a year or two
before, the ship <i>Boyd</i> had been seized in Whangaroa
Harbour, and her company, numbering fifty persons,
had been butchered and eaten.</p>

<p>With these facts before their minds to encourage
them, Marsden and his brave companions went unhesitatingly
into what must have seemed the very
jaws of death, resolved to sow the gospel seed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
this virgin wild. In December, 1814, the Revs.
Marsden, Kendall, King, and Nicholas landed here
at Te Puna. Public worship was held here for the
first time on Christmas Day.</p>

<p>At that period there was a large population on
the shores and islands of the bay, which has since
disappeared or moved elsewhere, for the most part.
There would seem to have been a considerable
kainga either at or near Te Puna. Here, therefore,
land was bought, houses and a church of some
kind put up, and the mission duly inaugurated.
One of the missionaries was actually accompanied
by his wife, and she gave birth to a son shortly after
they landed. He was the first white man born in
New Zealand, and he still resides near the bay, with
other families descended from the same parents.
Some of us have often partaken of their hospitality.</p>

<p>There is no mission at Te Puna now, and only
the two households for population, but the original
mission continued there a good many years. Soon
after its origination, another station was opened on
the Keri-keri river, about twenty miles from Te
Puna. Here there is a stone block-house, which
was erected for defence, if necessary. It is now
used as a store. There is besides a most comfortable
homestead, the residence of a family descended
from one of the early missionaries. It is a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
pleasant spot, with all the air of an English country
grange, save and except that block-house, and other
mementoes of the past that our hospitable hosts
have been pleased to show us.</p>

<p>Some miles along the shore of the bay, from the
point where the Keri-keri estuary opens from it, we
come to Paihia, at the mouth of the Waitangi.
This is directly opposite to Kororareka, from which
it is five or six miles distant. Just down the shore
is a villa residence, and one or two other houses,
indicating the farm of a wealthy settler. A splendidly
situated home that, with its glorious view
over the picturesque bay, its surrounding gardens
and orchards, and its background of woods and
mountains. Here was where the first printing-press
in New Zealand was set up.</p>

<p>Near by, but opening upon the Waitangi rather
than on the bay, is a deep, dark glen. At the
bottom of it, and filling the lower ground, are the
wharès and cultivations of a good-sized Maori
kainga. There are some frame-houses, too, which
show how civilized our brown fellow-subjects are
becoming. And from here we can row up the
winding Waitangi river to another point of interest.</p>

<p>Some miles above, the influx of the tides is
stopped by high falls, just as it also is in the Keri-keri
river, close to the old station. Waitangi Falls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
is the port for all the inland country on this side.
There is a young settlement here, and the place is
remarkable for being the spot where the famous
treaty was signed. Moreover, the falls are well
worth looking at.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting stories relating to the
Bay of Islands is that of the first Maori war, which
was waged around it from 1845 to 1847. It has
been related often enough, and I can only find room
for some very brief details. Such as they are, they
are mostly gathered from the oral narrations of eye-witnesses,
both English and Maori, whose testimony
I feel more inclined to believe than that of some
printed accounts I have seen.</p>

<p>Hone Heke was the leader of one of the sections
into which the great Ngapuhi tribe had split after
the death of the celebrated Hongi Hika, who expired
March 5, 1828. Captain Hobson's friend,
Tamati Waka, was chief of another section; while
Kawiti, another chief, headed a third. These
persons were then paramount over pretty nearly the
whole region lying between Mongonui and the
Kaipara. They had been among the confederate
chiefs whom the British Government recognized as
independent in 1835; and their signatures were, subsequently
to that, attached to the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>

<p>Shortly after the proclamation of New Zealand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
as a British possession, Governor Hobson, seeing
that Kororareka was unsuited for a metropolis, removed
the seat of government to the Waitemata,
and there commenced a settlement which is now
the city of Auckland. Order had been restored in
the former place, but its importance and its trade
now fell away.</p>

<p>The Ngapuhi had some grievances to put up
with. The trade of the Bay was much lessened;
import duties raised the price of commodities;
while the growing importance of Auckland gave
advantages to the neighbouring tribes, the Ngatitai,
Ngapaoa, Waikato, and Ngaterangi, which the
Ngapuhi of the Bay of Islands had formerly monopolized.
It needed but little to foment the discontent
of a somewhat turbulent ruler such as
Hone Heke.</p>

<p>In the year 1844 this chief, visiting Kororareka,
and probably venting his dissatisfaction at the new
regime pretty loudly, was incited by certain of the
bad characters, who had previously had it all their
own way in the place. They taunted him with
having become the slave of a woman, showing him
the flag, and explaining that it meant his slavery
to Queen Victoria, together with all Maoris. In
such a way they proceeded to work up his feelings,
probably without other intention than to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
a rise out of the Maori's misconception of the
matter.</p>

<p>Hone Heke took the thing seriously. He said
that he did not consider himself subject to any one.
He was an independent chief, merely in alliance
with the British, and had signed the Treaty of
Waitangi in expectation of receiving certain rewards
thereby, which it appeared had been changed into
penalties. As for the flag, if that was an emblem
of slavery, a Pakeha fetish, or an insult to Maoridom,
it was clear that it ought to be removed, and he
was the man to do it.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he and his followers then present,
marched at once up the hill above Kororareka, and
cut down the flagstaff that had been set up there.
Then they withdrew quietly enough. The settlers
were much disconcerted, having no means of coercing
Heke, and not knowing to what this might
lead. However, they set the flagstaff up again.</p>

<p>Hone Heke appeared once more with his band,
this time in fierce anger. They cut down the
restored flagstaff, and either threw it into the sea,
or burnt it, or carried it off. Heke also threatened
to destroy Kororareka if any attempt was made to
fly the British flag again.</p>

<p>H.M.S. <i>Hazard</i> now came up from Auckland,
where considerable excitement agitated the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
settlement. The flagstaff was again restored, and,
this time, a small block-house was built round it,
which was garrisoned by half a dozen soldiers.</p>

<p>Now, Hongi Hika, previous to his death, had enjoined
a certain policy upon his successors. He had
told them never to make war upon such Pakeha as
came to preach, to farm, or to trade. These were
not to be plundered or maltreated in any way.
They were friends whose presence could only tend
to the advantage of the Maori. But the English
sovereign kept certain people whose only business
was to fight. They might be known by the red
coats they wore, and by having stiff necks with a
collar round them. "Kill these wherever you see
them," said Hongi; "or they will kill you."</p>

<p>So Hone Heke sent an ultimatum into Kororareka,
to the effect that, on a certain specified day, he
should burn the town, cut down the flagstaff, and
kill the soldiers. The attack was fixed for night,
and it came with exact punctuality. Most of the
inhabitants took refuge on board the <i>Hazard</i> and
some other craft then lying in the harbour; while
these prepared to guard the beach from a canoe
attack. Captain Robertson of the <i>Hazard</i>, with
some forty marines and blue-jackets, aided also by a
party of settlers, took up a position on the landward
side of the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Hone Heke's own mind seems to have principally
been occupied with the flagstaff. The main
attack he left to Kawiti, who had joined him, with
five hundred men. Heke himself, with a chosen
band, crept round unperceived through the bush,
and lay in wait near the top of the flagstaff hill, in a
little dingle, which is yet pointed out to visitors.
Here they lay for some hours, awaiting the signal of
Kawiti's attack upon the town below. While in this
position, Heke kept his men quiet by reading the
Bible to them, expounding the Scriptures as he
read; for all these Ngapuhi, whether friends or
foes, were professed Christians at that period.</p>

<p>By-and-by, the sound of firing and shouting in
the town, together with the blazing of some of the
houses, attracted the attention of the soldiers in the
little block-house round the flagstaff. Unsuspecting
any danger close at hand, they came out on to the
hill, the better to descry what was doing below.
Then Heke's ambush sprang suddenly up, and
rushed between them and the open door of the
block-house, thus capturing it, and either killing or
putting the startled soldiers to flight instantaneously.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a furious battle was taking place in
Kororareka. Captain Robertson and his small force
were outflanked and driven in upon the town, fighting
bravely and desperately. But the numbers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the Maoris were too great for them to contend with,
and Robertson, with half his men, was killed, the rest
escaping with difficulty to the ships. Then the
victorious assailants rushed upon the devoted settlement,
speedily joined by Heke's band on the opposite
side. The stores and houses were plundered and
set on fire, and soon Kororareka was a charred and
smoking heap of ruins, only the two churches being
left absolutely untouched. This was the first engagement
during the war, and was a decided success
for the rebels. The fall of Kororareka took place
March 11, 1845; Heke having first cut down the
flagstaff in July of the previous year.</p>

<p>The news reached Auckland a day or two later,
and something like a panic occurred there. The
settlers were armed and enrolled at once, and the
place prepared for defence; for it was said that
Heke and Kawiti had determined to destroy that
settlement as well. Had they been able to march
upon it then, it is possible that their attack could not
have been successfully withstood, so limited were
means of defence at that time.</p>

<p>But Tamati Waka, the stout-hearted friend of the
British, led out his section of the Ngapuhi at once,
and took up arms against their kinsmen under
Heke. He prevented the rebels from leaving their
own districts, and thus saved Auckland, allowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
time for reinforcements to reach New Zealand, and
so for the war to be carried into Heke's own country.
All through the campaign he did efficient service on
our behalf, contributing much to the final establishment
of peace.</p>

<p>Tamati Waka Nene, to give him his full name,
had been a savage cannibal warrior in the days of
Hongi. On one occasion then he had led a taua,
or war-party, of the Ngapuhi far to the south of
Hauraki Gulf, destroying and literally "eating-up"
a tribe in the Kati-kati district. Subsequently, he
embraced Christianity and civilization, but it is
evident that the old warrior spirit was strong in him
to the last. He was an extremely sagacious and
intelligent politician, fully comprehending the advantages
that must accrue to his race from British rule.
He enjoyed a government pension for some years
after the war, and, when he died, a handsome monument
was erected over his remains in Kororareka
churchyard. It stands not far from where bullet
and axe-marks in the old fence still show the spot
where Robertson fell.</p>

<p>When Heke found himself pledged to war, he
sent intimations to all the settlers living about
Waimate, Keri-keri, and the north of the bay, mostly
missionary families. He said he had no quarrel
with them, and would protect their persons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
property if they would trust him. Some remained,
and some took refuge in Auckland. Those who
stayed were never in any way molested; Heke kept
his word to them to the letter. But of those who
fled he allowed his men to pillage the farms and
houses, by way of utu for not believing him.</p>

<p>As soon as the authorities were in a position to
do so, a strong force was sent into the Bay district,
to operate in conjunction with Tamati Waka's men
in putting down the insurrection. Three engagements
were fought, resulting in advantage to the
British. The rebels were then besieged in the
fortified pa of Ohaeawae, some twenty-five miles
inland. No artillery had been brought up, and the
consequence was that our troops were repulsed from
before this pa again and again, with severe loss.
But the victory was too much for the rebels, who
suffered considerably themselves, and ran short of
ammunition. One night they silently evacuated the
place, which was entered next day by the British,
and afterwards destroyed. Very similar experiences
followed shortly after at the pa of Okaehau.</p>

<p>Finally, in 1847, the insurgents were beleaguered
in the pa of Ruapekapeka, situated near the Waitari
river. This they considered impregnable, and it
was indeed magnificently defended with earthworks
and palisades, arranged in such a manner as to excite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
the wonder and admiration of engineers. A model
of it was subsequently made and sent home.</p>

<p>Some artillery had now been got up, with immense
labour and difficulty owing to the rugged
character of the ground. These guns were brought
to bear upon the pa. But the Maoris had hung
quantities of loose flax over the palisades, which fell
into place again after the passage of a ball, and hid
the breach it had made. Thus the besiegers could
not tell what they had effected, while the defenders
were enabled to repair the gaps unseen.</p>

<p>The pa was taken in rather a curious way. It
happened that no engagement had been fought on a
Sunday, and the rebels, being earnest Christians, and
having&mdash;as Maoris have to this day&mdash;a respect for
the Sabbath, more exaggerated than that of the Scots
even, concluded that an armistice was a matter of
course. When Sunday morning came, they went
out of the pa at the back to hold worship after their
manner. Tamati Waka's men, perceiving this, conquered
their own Sabbatical leanings, and, finding
an opening, rushed into the pa, followed by the
British troops. The disconcerted worshippers attempted
to retake the pa, but were speedily routed
and scattered.</p>

<p>This event terminated the war. The insurgents
were broken and disheartened, their numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
reduced, their strongholds captured, and their ammunition
exhausted. They soon all laid down arms
and sued for pardon. Ever since, all the sections of
the rebel tribe have been perfectly peaceable, and
take pride in the epithet earned by Tamati Waka's
force, "the loyal Ngapuhi," which is now to be
applied to the entire tribe.</p>

<p>This first Maori war presents some considerable
contrasts to those which had afterwards to be waged
with other tribes, in Wellington, Nelson, Taranaki,
and Waikato. It was characterized by humanity on
both sides, and by an approach to the usages of
conflict between civilized peoples. The Ngapuhi
had had the missionaries among them longer than
any other tribe, and had benefited greatly from their
teaching. Some barbarity they still showed, perhaps,
but their general conduct was widely different from
what it would have been twenty or thirty years
before.</p>

<p>At the attack on Kororareka, a woman and
several other fugitives were made prisoners. They
were treated kindly, and next day Hone Heke sent
them on board the ships in the harbour. A settler
informed me that he was once conveying wounded
soldiers in a bullock-dray, from the front at Ohaeawae
down to the bay. On the road, a party of Heke's
men suddenly appeared out of the bush and sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>rounded
them. They were quite friendly, however,
grounding their arms for a sociable smoke and chat.
They counted the wounded soldiers, giving them
fruit, and assisting at the passage of a dangerous
creek. At parting, they merely reminded the
soldiers that if they came back they would be
killed, as they, the rebels, intended to kill or drive
away all the red-coats.</p>

<p>Waimate is the most important centre to the
north of the Bay of Islands; it lies about ten miles
inland from Waitangi Falls. The roads from Waitangi
to Waimate, to Ohaeawae and Okaehau, are really
good. A buggy might even be driven along them with
perfect ease. Only, between Waitangi and Waimate
there is a formidable creek, the bridge over which
is continually being swept away by floods. Then
one must cross by a difficult and shifting ford, and, if
the creek be full, it may be necessary to swim one's
horse over, as once happened to me, I remember.</p>

<p>On proceeding inland in this district, the ground
loses its ruggedness. It is not flat, exactly, but it is
only gently undulating, and not so violently broken
as in most other parts of the north. The soil is
volcanic, the ground mostly open, and much of it
splendidly fertile, like that of the Bay of Naples.
There are extinct craters and old lava streams here
and there; but there has been no evidence of activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
in them within the memory of man or of Maori
tradition. The district of active volcanoes, solfataras,
hot-springs, geysers, and so on, lies beyond the
limits of the Land of the Kauri altogether.</p>

<p>Waimate was settled by the early missionaries.
It includes lands held by the representatives of three
parent Societies. It is a large village, composed of
residences that may well be termed villas. Nearly
all the inhabitants belong to missionary families, and
they form a sort of little aristocracy here to themselves.
There is a kind of old-world air about the
place: it seems to be standing still while the rest of
New Zealand is progressing fast and furiously around
it. The people are the soul of kindly hospitality, but
they are a little exclusive from the very fact of
having lived here all their lives, and of having seen
but little of the outside world. For the same
reason, and because new settlers do not come up,
owing to the land not being readily obtainable, they
are somewhat averse from movement, and inclined
to jog along in a settled groove.</p>

<p>I know of no place in the colony that presents
such a striking resemblance to a quiet, stick-in-the-mud,
rural locality of the old country. The
Europeans are the gentry, and the Maoris round
might pose as the rest of the population.</p>

<p>There is a handsome church at Waimate, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
there is no hotel, though there are very good ones
at Waitangi and Ohaeawae. There are yards and
pens to accommodate a horse, cattle, sheep, and
pig-market, which is held here at regular intervals.
Waimate is a great farming centre, some of the
lands about it having been under the plough for
fifty years; still, it is a trifle backward in its modes,
the farmers not striving to make a pile, but being
content to keep themselves in competence. This
may also be esteemed a central point of modern
Maori civilization.</p>

<p>There are a number of young families growing
up at Waimate, amid the softening influences of
its homely refinement. Among them are an unusual
number of young ladies. Whatever may be the
faults of the place, with regard to its lack of energy
and backwardness in farming industry, it redeems
them all by the abundant crop of first-class British
rosebuds it is raising for the delectation of hungry
bachelors.</p>

<p>Well do I remember, once, Dandy Jack rejoining
a party of us, who were up at Kawa-kawa on
business. There was such a look of beatified
content upon his face, that we all exclaimed at it.
He told us he had been stopping at a house where
there were ten lovely girls, between the ages of
fourteen and twenty-six. He had come to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
us an invitation to go and visit there, too. Within
half an hour every horse was saddled, and every
individual of us, having completed his most killing
toilette, was on the road to this bush-nursery of
Beauty!</p>

<p>Six or eight miles from Waimate we come to
Ohaeawae, a place of very great interest. The
most conspicuous object is the beautiful church,
whose tall spire mounts from a rising ground in the
centre of the settlement. That church occupies the
very site of the old pa, and, what is more, it was
built entirely at the expense, and partly by the
actual labour, of the very Maoris who fought the
British here in Heke's war.</p>

<p>With the exception of the principal store and
hotel, and possibly of one or two other houses near,
Ohaeawae is a Maori town. A few miles further
along the road is yet another straggling settlement,
whose name I forget, and all is mainly Maori.
These natives here are even further ahead than we
are in the Kaipara. They have good frame-houses
in all styles of carpentering; they have pastures
fattening their flocks and herds and droves; they
have their ploughs and agricultural machinery; and
fields of wheat, potatoes, maize, and what not.
They use the telegraph and the post-office for
business or pleasure; they have their own schools,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
police, and handicrafts of various kinds. In short,
as a body, they seem quite as much civilized as if
they were white instead of brown. I suppose that,
round Ohaeawae and Okaehau and Waimate, the
Maori may be seen in the highest state of advancement
to which he has anywhere attained. But
more of him anon.</p>

<p>Between these settlements and the Hokianga
waters, the roads become more inchoate again, and
one passes through wild land, which gets more and
more covered with bush as one proceeds. Hokianga,
though it has its history of the early days, in common
with the Bay, is far behind it in progress. In fact,
Hokianga is a long way less forward than the
Kaipara, and there are very few settlers in it. Its
principal features are steep and lofty ranges, and a
rich luxuriance of forest. The scenery is magnificent.</p>

<p>Winding along down the Waima or Taheke
rivers, no eye so dull but must admire the glorious
woodland beauties around. Soft green willows
sweep the waters, and hide the banks below their
foliage like some natural jalousie. Above is a
bewildering thicket of beauty. Ferns, fern-trees,
fern-creepers, every variety of frond, mingled with
hanging masses of white star-flower, pohutukawa
trees one blaze of crimson, trees and shrubs of a
hundred varieties. And above tower lofty ranges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
covered to the topmost summit with dense impenetrable
woods, sparkling and gleaming with a
thousand tints in the brilliant sunshine and clear
atmosphere.</p>

<p>As the boat travels down the stream, teal and
wild-duck splash and glide and scuttle and fly
before it. The wild birds of the bush, that some
will have it are becoming extinct, are here to be
seen in greater numbers than anywhere else I know
of. Those rare green and scarlet parrots tumble and
shriek on the summits of the trees, while the large
purple sultana-ducks peep forth occasionally.</p>

<p>Here and there some vista opens, disclosing
a little Maori kainga, or the house and clearing
of a settler, who thinks more, perhaps, of living
amidst such natural beauty than of making a prosaic
pile in any less attractive spot. I love the Kaipara,
and I am in honour bound to deem Te Puke Tapu
on the Arapaoa the acme and perfection of woodland
glory&mdash;but, in the Hokianga, splendid and
magnificent, one forgets other places.</p>

<p>Take that gorge of the main estuary, for example,
just above Wirineki, where the Iwi Rua raises its
wild peaks, and sends its tremendous shoulders with
their ridgy backs and dark ravines, all clothed in
overwhelming wealth of forest, rushing down to the
blue water. What can one say but that it is simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
sublime! As Wales is to Scotland, so is this to the
Yosemite.</p>

<p>There is but little industry in Hokianga. There
are some sawmills, but they are comparatively small,
and do not add very largely to our timber trade.
There are some farms, but they, too, are small and
doing little. There are schools, but their work is
limited.</p>

<p>The principal settlement is Hurd's Point, to
which place a steamer comes from the Manukau
once a fortnight. It is claimed here that this
is actually the oldest settlement in New Zealand,
prior even to Kororareka. A man named Hurd
came here early in the century, and established a
store for trade with the Maoris; sailing vessels from
Sydney occasionally communicating with him.</p>

<p>The Point is about sixteen miles from the Heads.
There are somewhere about a dozen good houses,
two hotels and stores. A gentleman who lives here
has even more manifold occupations than our Mayor
of Te Pahi. But the population of this, and of the
district generally, is mainly Maori, or Maori half-breed.
One can trace in Hokianga some reminiscences
of the French invasion, of Baron Thierry,
and of the Pikopo, as the Maoris term the Roman
Catholic mission.</p>

<p>While the civilization of the Maoris has advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
further here and at Ohaeawae than it has almost
anywhere else, it is curious that some very primitive
kaingas lie to the north of Hokianga. I suppose
that nowhere in the North could you find places
where there is less of Pakeha civilization and more of
ancient Maori manners, than in one or two of these.
They are completely secluded, and have scarcely
any intercourse with strangers.</p>

<p>At these places I have been hospitably entertained,
in true Maori fashion, and have found a large
amount of genial, kindly friendliness. Some of the
elders had not forgotten Heke's war, in which they
had taken part. It seemed to them to be an event
of yesterday only. They spoke of it as of something
amusing, a good joke on the whole, and
without any apparent feeling that there had been
anything serious in it.</p>

<p>Yet these people questioned me eagerly about
Akarana (Auckland), and things among the Pakeha.
I rose into immense dignity among them because I
had seen and could describe Te Kwini (the Queen),
Te Pirinti Weri (the Prince of Wales), Te Pirintiti
Weri (the Princess of Wales), and Te Pikanini
(the young princes and princesses). All the inhabitants
of the kainga, men, women, and children,
gathered round the fire in front of my wharè to
hear what I had to tell them. There was no end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
to their questions, and a sort of rapturous excitement
spread among them as I dilated on the subject
of our royal family. I think it would be no difficult
thing to raise a Maori legion for foreign service.
And I am quite sure that nowhere, in all the realm
upon which the sun never sets, has Queen Victoria
more devoted and enthusiastic subjects than she has
among her "loyal Ngapuhi."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such is a brief, a very brief account of our most
interesting region, crammed as it is with mementoes
of the past, that will grow dearer and more valued
to this country as time recedes from them. I have
but glanced at some prominent features. It would
take a volume or two to contain all that might be
written.</p>

<p>But when that railway which Old Colonial talks
of is completed, I intend to write a guide-book to the
three counties, with full historical details. It ought
to be a good spec., you know, when crowds of
tourists are rushing to "do" our classic ground!</p>

<small>MAORI MANNERS.</small></h2>

<p class="center">I.</p>


<p>Old Colonial says that no book about Northern
New Zealand, past or present, would be complete
without some special reference to Maori manners.
So, with his larger experience to aid me, I am going
to try and depict them, in brief and to a limited
extent. Perhaps the best way to begin is by
sketching the early history of the race, so far as it
is known. Also, we will be pedantic for the nonce,
and such words of the native tongue as are used
shall be free from European corruptions. Thus, to
begin with, there being no "s" in the language,
which only consists of fourteen letters, and no plural
termination, Maori (pr. <i>mowry</i>) stands for either
one or many, and Pakeha (white man, stranger,
pr. <i>Pah-kay-hah</i>) signifies either the singular or
plural number.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>The Maori are a Turanian race, belonging to
the Polynesian family of the Malay branch. According
to their own traditions, they came to New
Zealand from some island in the South Sea, known
to them as Hawaiiki. Probably they had migrated
in the first instance from the Malay Peninsula. A
certain number of large canoes landed the pilgrim
fathers of the race on the shores of Ahinamaui,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the
names of which are remembered, each of the tribes
tracing its ancestry to one. The date of this incursion
is reckoned to have been about <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1400; the
calculation being arrived at by comparison of certain
genealogical tally-sticks kept among the tribes.</p>

<p>The Maori would seem to have degenerated
from some more civilized condition, as is evidenced
by the remains among them of astronomical knowledge,
and of a higher political constitution, the
basis of which is discoverable in their institution of
the tapu. They brought with them to New Zealand
the kumera (sweet potato), the taro (bread-root),
the hue (gourd), the seeds of the koraka tree, the
dog, the pukeko (swamp-hen), and one or two of
the parrot tribe. They found in New Zealand an
aboriginal race of men, inferior to themselves.
They also found several species of gigantic birds,
called by them moa, and by naturalists <i>Dinornis</i>,
<i>Aptornis</i>, and <i>Palapteryx</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>The Maori, of course, made war upon both man
and bird, the latter for food from the first, and the
former probably for the same purpose eventually.
They had succeeded in exterminating both before
Europeans had a chance of making acquaintance
with them. Bones of the moa are frequently found,
and, till recently, it was believed that living specimens
existed in the recesses of forest and mountain.
But of the aboriginal race no trace remains, unless,
as some have thought, there be an admixture of
their blood in the few Maori of Otago and Stewart
Island.</p>

<p>New Zealand was discovered by Abel Jan van
Tasman, in 1642, to whom it owes its name&mdash;a name,
by the way, that may one day be changed to
Zealandia, perhaps, just as New Holland has become
Australia, and Van Diemen's Land, Tasmania.
The natives received the Dutch navigator with
hostility, massacring a boat's crew. He, therefore,
drew off and left, merely coasting for a short
distance. No one else visited the country until
1769, when Cook arrived in it for the first time.</p>

<p>Captain Cook was likewise received with hostility
by the Maori, on his first landing in Poverty
Bay. But afterwards, in the Bay of Plenty, Mercury
Bay, and the Bay of Islands, he met with better
treatment, and was able to establish friendly rela<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>tions
with certain tribes. He spent altogether
nearly a year in New Zealand, between 1769 and
1777, in which last year he left for Hawaii, to meet
his death there in Kealakekua Bay. He circumnavigated
the islands, which had previously been
supposed to form part of a great Antarctic continent.
He also bestowed upon the Maori the pig and the
potato, and has left us some still interesting accounts
of what he observed in the country.</p>

<p>Subsequently to Cook's last visit, and in the
intervals between his voyages, other explorers
touched here. De Lunéville, De Surville, Crozet,
D'Urville, and Du Fresne, the French navigators,
followed in the footsteps of Tasman and Cook.
Then, too, whalers began to call along the coasts;
and, by-and-by, traders from Sydney adventured
hither for timber, and flax (<i>phormium</i>), and pigs,
and smoked heads. But it was a risky thing in
those days to do business with the Maori. Any
fancied slight or injury was resented most terribly.
Several ships were lost altogether, their crews being
butchered and eaten; while boats' crews and individual
mariners were lost by others.</p>

<p>In 1772, Du Fresne, with fifteen of his men, was
killed in the Bay of Islands. He had aroused the
wrath of the natives by trespassing on tapu ground;
and they also avenged on him an action of De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Lunéville's, who had rashly put a chief in irons. In
1809, the ship <i>Boyd</i> was taken in Whangaroa Harbour,
and all her company killed, because the
captain had flogged a Maori thief. Again, in 1816,
we hear of the American brig <i>Agnes</i> meeting with
a similar fate in Poverty Bay, or thereabouts.</p>

<p>From the end of last century down to 1840, a
few individual white men took up their residence
among the Maori here and there. These Pakeha-Maori,
as they are called, were runaway sailors, or
such as had been shipwrecked or made prisoners,
or were wild, adventurous characters who preferred
the savage life to the restraints of civilization.
They married Maori women, raised families, and
conformed to all the native customs, sometimes
becoming chiefs and leaders in war. When some
fitful intercourse was established with Sydney, these
men were the medium of trade, and achieved
immense importance in that way. It soon became
the fashion among the chiefs of tribes for each to
have his own special Pakeha-Maori. Force was
sometimes resorted to to obtain these men. They
were captured and compelled to remain, while wars
between rival tribes were conducted for the possession
of them. Rutherford, a survivor of the
<i>Agnes</i>, was one such. His experiences of twelve
years' residence among the Maori are recorded in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
Lord Brougham's compilation. Judge Maning has
related the tale of another, at a somewhat later date.</p>

<p>In 1814, as has been elsewhere mentioned, the
Rev. Samuel Marsden, together with some other
missionaries, landed in the Bay of Islands; and
from that event, New Zealand's real history may be
said to commence.</p>

<p>The story of Marsden's interest in New Zealand
is not without a certain romantic element. He was
chaplain to the Government of New South Wales.
At Sydney he had many opportunities of hearing
of New Zealand, and of the terrible race of fighting
man-eaters who inhabited it. Traders spoke freely
of all they knew, and the barbarities, treacheries,
and fearful deeds of the Maori, much exaggerated,
no doubt, were matters of common report. Moreover,
individual Maori sometimes shipped as sailors
on board the vessels that touched on their coasts;
and so Marsden was able to judge of the character
of the race from the actual specimens he saw. We
may be sure that he was favourably impressed by
their evident superiority in every way to the black
aborigines of Australia.</p>

<p>Marsden was in England in 1809, and there he
vainly endeavoured to awaken sympathy on behalf
of the Maori, and to persuade the Christian public
to make effort for their help. On his return, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
noticed, among the sailors of his ship, a coloured
man, very sick and dejected. Him he made acquaintance
with, finding him to be Ruatara, a Maori
of the chieftain rank, belonging to the Ngapuhi tribe.</p>

<p>Ruatara had had an eventful time of it. In
1805, when a mere lad of eighteen, he had shipped
on board a whaler, hoping thereby to see something
of the world. In her he was treated badly, being
marooned on a desert island for some months, and
eventually brought back again to New Zealand,
without more experience than a whaling cruise in
the South Sea could give him.</p>

<p>But, nothing daunted by these vicissitudes, he
again shipped on board a whaler, and in her was
carried to London. This was the acme of his
desires, for his great idea was to see King George.
But, all the time the ship lay in dock, Ruatara was
scarcely allowed to go on shore, even, and was not
permitted to carry his wishes into execution. He
appears to have been brutally ill-treated, and was
finally turned over to a convict ship, the <i>Ann</i>,
bound for Port Jackson. On board of her Marsden
sailed, and saw and took this forlorn wretch, ill and
disappointed, under his protection.</p>

<p>Arrived in Sydney, Marsden took Ruatara to
his own house, and kept him there as his guest for
some months, doing his best, meanwhile, we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
be sure, to enlighten the mind of the barbarian
whom Providence had thrown in his way. Finally,
he took means to send Ruatara home to his own
country.</p>

<p>The Church Missionary Society, stirred by
Marsden's representations, at last sent out a missionary
party. But on their arrival in Sydney the
members of it hesitated about venturing to New
Zealand&mdash;the affair of the <i>Boyd</i>, and similar deeds,
being just then fresh in the colonial mind. Marsden,
however, was not to be daunted.</p>

<p>In 1814 he sent a vessel to the Bay of Islands,
loaded with useful presents, and bearing an invitation
to Ruatara to visit him once more. It was
readily accepted, not only by Ruatara, but also by
several other chiefs, including the subsequently
famous Hongi Hika, who was uncle to Ruatara.
These persons were hospitably entertained by
Marsden at his residence at Paramatta. Towards
the end of the year, they returned to New Zealand,
and with them went Marsden and his companions,
landing at Te Puna in December of that year, as
has been elsewhere spoken of.</p>

<p>This is the first appearance of the redoubtable
Hongi. Both he and Ruatara took the missionaries
under their protection, and firmly maintained that
attitude as long as they lived. Neither of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
embraced Christianity; but Hongi's care for the
missionaries is shown in the charge he gave to his
successors on his death-bed concerning them, which
I have recorded in a previous chapter. Ruatara
was a man of much milder disposition than his uncle,
though both appeared well-mannered, courteous,
amiable, and eminently sagacious when among
Europeans. Ruatara would probably have become
a convert, had he not died soon after the advent
of Marsden.</p>

<p>During this period many of the Maori evinced
great desire to travel, and especially to see England
and its king. They were ready to undergo any
amount of hardship and ill-treatment to accomplish
this. Numbers shipped as seamen on board such
vessels as would receive them. Sometimes they
resorted to amusing tricks in order to get carried
to England. Tupei Kupa, for example, a powerful
chief in the neighbourhood of Cook Straits, came
on board a ship passing along the coast, and resisted
all endeavours, even force, to make him return.
He was eventually made to serve as a sailor, and
seems to have become a general favourite. He
resided some time in Liverpool, afterwards being
sent home by Government.</p>

<p>Hongi was affected by the same spirit. In 1820
he, accompanied by another chief, Waikato, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
under the charge of Rev. Mr. Kendall, visited
England. There he was presented to King George,
and was made much of. The two chiefs aided Mr.
Kendall and Professor Lee in the compilation of
the first Maori vocabulary. They returned to
Sydney loaded with many and valuable presents.</p>

<p>But in Sydney the true character of Hongi came
out. He realized all his property, and converted it
into muskets, powder, and ball. With these he
sailed joyfully back to his own country. Arrived
there, he set about arming his fighting men and
instructing them in the use of the new acquisitions.
He also became very friendly to such trading vessels
as touched on his coasts, giving them cargoes of
such produce as the country afforded in return for
more arms.</p>

<p>This chief's ambition was to constitute himself
king of all New Zealand, just as King George was
sovereign over all Britain. His theory of the way
to bring this about seems to have been by killing
and eating all who opposed the project. There
were some thirty tribes of the Maori, and these
were divided and subdivided into various little
sections. Sometimes a powerful chief was dominant
over a large confederation; and, again, each little
kainga regarded itself as independent.</p>

<p>Originally, Hongi was ariki (head chief or king)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of the Ngapuhi, and ruled over the inhabitants of
the districts round the Bay of Islands, and between
that and the west coast. As soon as he had returned
from England, and had achieved the possession of
fire-arms, he converted his previously somewhat
loose lordship into a real despotism. He organized
a taua (army, regiment, or war-party), and quickly
reduced any unruly sections to obedience. Then he
attacked the Ngatipo of Whangaroa, the Ngararawa
of Whangape, and the Ngaopuri of the North Cape.
These he massacred, devoured, and dispersed, swelling
the ranks of his army with accessions from
among the subdued tribes.</p>

<p>After this, various expeditions, under the command
of Hongi, or his sub-chiefs, marched southward
to slay and eat all and sundry. The Ngatewhatua,
a populous tribe of the Kaipara districts,
had to bear the brunt of Hongi's advance, and were
almost annihilated. He penetrated a long way
south, ever victorious over every one by reason of
his superior weapons. There is little doubt that he
must have sometimes led an army of as many as five
thousand men, mostly armed with muskets. This
was a prodigious force for Maori war, irrespective of
the enormous advantage of powder and ball over
the native merè (battle-axe) and patu (a sort of
halberd).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the spirit of the Maori, and such their
warlike ferocity, that tribes never thought of submitting
peaceably, or fled from superior strength.
They always fought first. It is difficult to realize,
nowadays, the awful carnage that Hongi instituted.
Districts were depopulated, tribes annihilated, men,
women, and children, in scores and hundreds,
were butchered and eaten; pa and kainga were
burnt and destroyed.</p>

<p>Far to the south went the bloodthirsty conquerors,
even into what afterwards came to be the province
of Wellington. Ngapaoa, Ngatewaikato, Ngatimaniapoto,
Ngatiawa, and many another tribe felt the
full force of Hongi's lust for conquest. Even to the
East Cape his terrible warriors came, decimating
Ngateurewera and Ngatiporu. Of these latter they
once roasted and ate fifteen hundred, at a single one
of their cannibal orgies.</p>

<p>But Hongi did not become king of New Zealand
after all. He received a wound in battle, which
brought him to his death in 1828. In spite of his
propensities for war and cannibalism, both of which,
one may say, were hereditary in the Maori blood at
that time, Hongi would seem to have possessed
many good qualities. His intellect was quick and
vigorous, and would have distinguished him among
any people. His ingenuity was great, both in over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>coming
difficulties and in the arts which the
Maori used, or that had been taught him by Europeans.
His bravery was undoubted, and was
mingled with much large-hearted generosity. He
had good impulses, and was singularly affectionate
to his own family. To him missionaries and white
traders owed the first footing they obtained in the
country, and the ability to hold their own there
afterwards.</p>

<p>From the period of Marsden's first visit the
labours of the missionaries began to bear fruit, and
Christianity spread, at first slowly, but afterwards
with marvellous rapidity and completeness. Soon
after Hongi's death a more peaceful era commenced:
arms were less often employed; cannibalism was
given up among christianized tribes; and peaceful
arts were more attended to. In 1823, a Wesleyan
mission was established, first of all in Whangaroa;
and, in 1837, a Roman Catholic one was commenced
in Hokianga. By 1840 the whole of the tribes of
the Maori were professedly Christian, and had
relinquished their old warlike customs.</p>

<p>In 1864 there arose a singular religious revival
among the Maori, known by the name of Hau-hau.
This was just at the period when the Waikato war
was concluded, and when certain sections of various
tribes in the interior had declared themselves inde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>pendent
under a king of their own election. Hau-hau
was instituted by some of the old tohunga
(priests, prophets, and medicine-men), mainly from
political motives. They said that as there was an
English Church, a Scottish Church, and a Roman
Church, that there ought also to be a distinctive
Maori Church. They accordingly set to work to
form one.</p>

<p>Hau-hau consists of a frenzied form of Christianity,
mingled with some observances taken from
the Mosaic Law, and comprehending old heathenish
usages grafted upon the new order of things. From
the extraordinary excitement its professors manifest,
some people have thought that mesmeric influence
had a part in it.</p>

<p>Hau-hau became a political movement, being
inseparably connected with the "king" rebellion.
The Kingite Maori have given a good deal of
trouble in former years, but have now been quiescent
for long. Their territory occupies Kawhia county
on the West Coast, being bounded by the Waikato,
Waipa, and Mokau rivers, and the sea. Their
numbers are but few.</p>

<p>Till lately these rebels held themselves wholly
aloof from intercourse with the outside world, and
threatened any one who should enter their territory.
At last they began to bring produce to the nearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Pakeha market, and to buy stores, though still maintaining
their reserve. In 1881 there arose some
dispute about land that had been confiscated after
the war, but that had not been taken possession of.
There was talk of a furious row between the rebels
and the settlers. This was magnified by English
newspapers into a "threatened Maori war," an
absurd piece of ignorance, truly!</p>

<p>The "war" was put an end to the other day, by
a few policemen arresting the "King," in the midst
of his dominions and surrounded by his subjects,
and conveying him off to durance vile at Wellington.
A demonstration of Taranaki volunteers was enough.
No blood was spilt; no violence offered.</p>

<p>Maori wars are things of the past entirely.
When are British journalists going to awake to that
fact? Now, settlers outnumber Maori everywhere
ten to one. There are roads and railways and
steamers, sufficient to convey constabulary to any
riotous neighbourhood pretty quickly. But the
great point is that the Maori of the present day are
decent, quiet, and orderly folk. They are intelligent,
and possess as much civilization as would be found
in many rural districts of England, Scotland, and
Wales&mdash;I will not add of Ireland, too, for fear I
should be Boycotted! Maori and settler are on
perfectly equal terms, and the former know it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
moreover, they are not an homogeneous people, but
live scattered in small communities. The Kingites,
who are the least civilized, and who profess not to
acknowledge our authority, showed what they thought
of the possibilities of war by their submission to
a party of constables the other day. There is
no strength among them to make a war if they
wished it, which they are much too sagacious to do.
Riots, or brigandage, even, in isolated localities,
are less to be feared than similar outbreaks in
Lancashire or Staffordshire.</p>

<p>To read, as we did a short while ago, in influential
London newspapers, that war with the Maori was
again imminent, strikes us as excessively ludicrous.
"Our shanty" even regards it as a dire insult, and
there was some talk among us of going to war ourselves&mdash;with
the fourth estate in England. Anyhow,
it shows how little our friends at home really know
about this land of the blest and the free. Have
there not been books enough written about it <i>yet</i>?</p>

<p>There are, it is true, a good many Maori who
adhere to primitive custom. Here and there you
may find a kainga, containing from a score to a
hundred souls, where there is not much apparent
advance from the state of things fifty years back.
But even here you will find that men and women
turn out in European clothes, on occasions of state;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
that the children receive schooling of some sort;
that there is a surprising degree of intelligence and
knowledge of the great world and its ways; and
that there is a fervent, and often dogmatic, Christianity
among the inhabitants.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are Maori of a more
cultivated condition, and these have no small influence
with their less sophisticated compatriots.
Maori members sit in both houses of the Legislature;
Maori have votes at elections; there are some
comparatively wealthy Maori; there are Maori
farmers, store-keepers, hotel-keepers, artisans, policemen,
postmen, teachers, and clergymen. There are
two or three Maori newspapers, partly written by
Maori, for Maori to buy and read. They are no
longer to be regarded as savages, or as a distinct
race, even. They are but one of the classes of our
community.</p>

<p>The present total Maori population is no more
than 42,819; and the European population is 463,729.
In 1874 the Maori numbered 46,016, so they have
decreased considerably since then. But it is probable
that the numbers six years ago were not taken
with the same accuracy as at the last census, so that
it would, perhaps, be too hasty to say that the race
has decreased by 3000 during the last six years;
yet this estimate cannot be very far from the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Maori race are dying
out, and that with great rapidity. At the beginning
of this century&mdash;about 1820&mdash;the missionaries estimated
their numbers to be 100,000, a guess that
most likely fell far short of the truth. The frightful
slaughtering that followed the introduction of fire-arms
had, no doubt, much to do with the diminution
of the population, but evidently that can have no
effect at the present day; nor have the wars we
have fought with certain tribes, subsequent to 1840,
been of such a bloody nature as to be set down
among the immediate causes of decrease.</p>

<p>It has been too hastily assumed that the Maori
were lessening before the advent of Europeans. It
has been erroneously supposed that they were half-starved,
and that they had no option but to resort to
cannibalism. Both conclusions are certainly mistaken
ones, I feel convinced.</p>

<p>In the first place, when the Maori came to New
Zealand, four or five centuries ago, only a very
limited number could have arrived. A long and
hazardous voyage must have been undertaken in
frail canoes, and it is not to be supposed that an
entire nation could have so migrated. Moreover, it
is probable that the immigrants were driven here
accidentally, by stress of weather, possibly. Otherwise,
if they were able to voyage about so success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>fully
in the open ocean, at will, surely they would
have kept up communication with "Hawaiiki," or
other islands, which we know they did not.</p>

<p>It seems clear, therefore, that but a few people
originated the Maori inhabitants of New Zealand,
and as these were certainly at one time very
numerous, it is apparent that after their coming they
had gone on increasing and multiplying. At what
period, and for what reason, did this process of
increase become checked, and change to one of
decrease?</p>

<p>When Europeans first became acquainted with
the country, the Maori had by no means occupied
the whole of it, or even nearly so, nor had they exhausted
its resources for the support of life. They
were cannibals; but it has been abundantly proved
that they were not so from necessity. Cannibalism
was a part of the ceremonial of war and victory&mdash;nothing
more. It was never looked upon as a mere
means of livelihood.</p>

<p>It is true, that the Maori had no animals except
dogs and rats, both of which they ate; but flesh is
not an absolute necessity of existence. They had
fish of many kinds in marvellous profusion; they
cultivated assiduously the kumera and taro, alone
sufficient for the support of life. Such crops as these
hardly ever fail in this climate. Then there was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
fern-root everywhere, a regular article of diet with
them, and sundry other roots and herbs. Some
writers have assumed that when the moa had been
hunted down and destroyed, there was no other food
available, and so the tribes turned on each other.
This is monstrously absurd. There is no evidence
to show that moa were ever so plentiful as to have
been a principal part of the food-supply. There is
plenty of traditional evidence to prove that other
and smaller birds were more generally used as diet.
There is no proof that the Maori were ever in want
of means of subsistence. As matter of fact they
were not. They never knew what famine was, in
the sense in which it has at times been understood
in Western Ireland or the Hebrides.</p>

<p>Now war, at that prehistoric period, was a very
different thing from what it afterwards became, when
fire-arms were introduced. From the very earliest
time, according to their legends, war was the main
employment of the Maori. But their wars were
not of a kind to cause large devastation. Usually
they were Homeric combats, where one or two
persons were slain on either side. Vast preparations
were made for an event of this kind. Rival tribes
mustered all their strength; and, with much ceremony,
the taua of each came together at some
appointed place. Then for days there was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
talking and boasting, and various single duels, resulting
in little or nothing. Eventually a general
engagement would ensue. Hundreds might take
part in it, but rarely were there a dozen or a score
of casualties. So we gather from such accounts as
have reached us. Incessant though the inter-tribal
conflicts were, they were not of such a murderous
sort as to cause large general decrease. Extreme
old age was a very frequent thing, among even
prominent fighting-men, just as now there are
numerous very aged Maori.</p>

<p>So, it would seem that neither war nor want were
destroying the race before the coming of the Pakeha;
consequently it is not surprising to find that the
fact of their decreasing at all at that period is no
fact, and is but an opinion, a theory, an assumption
that appears to be devoid of any foundation whatsoever.</p>

<p>When fire-arms were introduced, general butcheries
commenced. Hongi initiated this era. But other
tribes eventually obtained the coveted weapon, and
then there was a carnival of blood all through the
land. Here we find the first real cause for general
decrease. These fearful wars must have enormously
diminished the numbers of the race.</p>

<p>But when Christianity laid hold of the Maori,
and when colonization came after it, there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
longer any reason left for a decrease among the
native population, at least, so one would have
thought; yet the numbers of the Maori have been
growing less and less with startling rapidity. The
decrease that is going on now, and that has been
going on since 1840, is evidently not owing to war
or to want. Other causes for it must be sought for.
The first Maori census was taken in 1874, and now
another enumeration has been made, showing a
considerable falling off since the other. Scarcely
an old settler but will tell of districts he knows,
where years ago there was a much larger native
population than there is to-day. It is evident that,
as civilization advances, and as Pakeha grow more
numerous in the country, the Maori are disappearing
faster and faster.</p>

<p>Many causes have been assigned for this. The
anti-alcoholists&mdash;of whom we have many eminent and
enthusiastic professors in the colony&mdash;of course, put
drink down as the chief reason. I do not think it
is, myself. Some Maori may drink themselves to
death, but, so far as my experience goes, I have
found them to be remarkably abstemious as a rule.
Many Maori will not touch liquor at all; many
more will take a little, but decline to drink excessively.
As one such remarked to me once&mdash;</p>

<p>"Little rum good. Makee jolly, dance, sing!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Much rum bad. Makee sleepy, makee head sore,
belly sore, all sore!"</p>

<p>A drunken Maori is comparatively rare in the
North, at least, as far as my observation goes. I
am rather inclined to take medical evidence on the
subject of Maori decrease. Certain diseases, introduced
by the Pakeha, have spread among them
extensively, and work fatally to their constitutions.
The women are thereby rendered less capable of
maternity, and the children fewer and more sickly.</p>

<p>A good deal of sentiment has been unnecessarily
wasted upon this matter. We do not need to raise
a cry of lamentation over the departing Maori. Let
him go; we shall get on well enough without him!
When the ordinary Englishman refers to the matter,
he says&mdash;</p>

<p>"They're a splendid race, those <i>Maries</i>! and
it's a thousand pities they should be dying out
so fast!"</p>

<p>With this commonly begins and ends the sum
of his knowledge of the matter. Now, the Maori
is not altogether such an absolutely superior person.
Relatively to some other aboriginal races&mdash;the
Australian black, for instance, and perhaps most of
the North American tribes&mdash;the Maori may truly
be described as a splendid race; but compared
with the Anglo-Saxon, the Maori is nowhere. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
cannot match our physical development nor our
intellectual capacity, average compared with average.</p>

<p>So, let the Maori go. We do not wish him to,
particularly. We are indifferent about the matter.
We would not hurry him on any account. Nay, we
will even sympathize with him, and sorrow for him&mdash;a
little. We are content to know that he will make
room for a superior race. It is but the process of
Nature's sovereign law. The weaker is giving way
to the stronger; the superior species is being developed
at the expense of the inferior.</p>

<p>In appearance, the Maori strike you favourably.
Their features are good, being quite in Caucasian
mould, though inclining a little to coarseness. Their
heads are well shaped, their bodies and limbs well
developed and muscular. They are somewhat long
in the back and short in the leg, as compared with
Europeans; and both men and women are able to
pikau (hump, or carry on the back and shoulders)
great weights for long distances.</p>

<p>The colour of the skin varies. In some it is
almost a coppery brown, in others a dusky olive.
The hair is black or brown, occasionally reddish.
The faces are open and intelligent, capable of much
expression, and pleasing when in repose. The eyes
are large and full, and the teeth naturally of dazzling
whiteness and regularity. Some of the young girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
are comely and pretty, but as they grow old they
often get repulsively ugly.</p>

<p>The average height is perhaps a little over that
of Englishmen; but the Maori are seldom over six
feet, and not often below five feet six inches. Deformed
persons are to be seen in every kainga,
where they are looked upon as, to some extent,
privileged by their misfortune.</p>

<p>The moku (tattooing) has gone out of fashion,
and is seldom seen on young men now, except
among very conservative communities. Plenty of
the older men, however, show it, and are still proud
of it. The women were never marked much, a line
or two about the mouth, and on the chin, was all
they were allowed.</p>

<p>The moku was not mere ornament or disfigurement.
It had a distinct heraldic meaning, and the
practice had attained to quite high art. The designs
are most elaborate, and were traced with exceeding
care. They consist of concentric lines and geometric
devices, each pattern having its peculiar signification.
The markings are of a blue colour; they are
principally displayed on the face and breast; and
they are so deeply set that the skin is ridged and
furrowed, looking as if carved.</p>

<p>The lower classes had but little moku, the more
intricate and elaborate patterns being reserved for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
men of rank. The higher a chief was, the more
elaboration did his moku display. When a man
rose in rank, he received additional decoration; just
as civilized governments confer orders, crosses, and
stars upon distinguished generals or statesmen.
Often the face was so covered that even the nostrils,
eyelids, and lobes of the ears were adorned with
minute tracery.</p>

<p>The operator who was entrusted with the making
of the moku, was a man of great importance, though
he might be of the lowest rank. The possession of
a skilled artist on skin was thought so much of in
the old days, that wars were sometimes waged to
determine who should benefit by his talent. He
was a sort of R.A., and M.R.C.S., and king-at-arms
in combination.</p>

<p>This individual had his cases of instruments,
little hoe-shaped chisels and gouges and knives,
made of sharks' teeth, flint, bone, and wood. Very
neat and beautifully finished weapons they were.
The pigments consisted of charcoal, a prepared red
earth, and the juice of the hinau tree.</p>

<p>The proud and happy patient was laid down on
his back, and forcibly held in position by assistants.
Then the operator sketched out the pattern on his
face with charcoal. Each line or dot was chiselled
in with a suitable tool, a wooden hammer being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
used to send the blade well into the flesh. The
blood of course gushed freely forth, and was scraped
off with an implement made for the purpose. The
pigments were rubbed into the incisions as these
were proceeded with. As may well be supposed,
the pain was simply excruciating, but it was considered
unmanly to flinch from it.</p>

<p>Subsequent inflammation was generally severe,
and might last for weeks, while the whole operation
would have to be effected bit by bit, over possibly
a year or two. To add to the hero's misery, all this
while he was tapu, or unclean, and could not touch
food with his hands, or live in a wharè (house).
Unless he was sedulously attended to by the ladies
of his family, as was the proper thing, he would
undergo no trifling amount of inconvenience.</p>

<p>The moku served a curious purpose at one time.
Clumsy though Maori fingers are, they seem to
have a natural aptitude for sketching and carving.
So, when the earliest missionaries and others called
upon certain chiefs to sign the title-deeds of estates
they had bought from them, the Maori did so by
drawing little sketches of the moku that adorned
their faces. Each said, "That is me, and no one
else." These curious autographs are still preserved
by the Societies in London.</p>

<p>It was the practice in the old days to preserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the heads of distinguished men who were slain in
battle. This was done by smoking and drying
them in such a way as to keep the emblazoned skin
intact. As soon as traders began to come from
Sydney, they were ready to barter valuable commodities
for these relics, which commanded high
fancy prices among the museums and curio-hunters
of Europe.</p>

<p>Great inducements were, therefore, offered to
trading Maori to bring heads into market. The
product seemed to be going to bring wealth into
the country, and industrial enterprise in this direction
speedily quickened. Trading tribes went to
war on all sides, in order that the supply of heads
might be fully up to the demand for them.</p>

<p>When this resource failed, some ingenious and
business-like potentate hit upon a splendid device.
Procuring the services of a first-class artist, he
caused him to adorn a number of slaves with the
most elaborate and high-art designs. Nothing was
to be spared; they were to be decorated in the
grandest style.</p>

<p>When a ship came that way again, and inquiry
was made by her captain as to the ruling prices
and possible supply of heads, among other commodities,
the new commercial scheme of these
simple people was at once propounded to him. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
chief caused a row of emblazoned slaves to be marshalled
before the trader, and told that gentleman
to pick out those he admired. Further, he was
assured that such as he deigned to choose should
be at once decapitated, their heads cured <i>secundem
artem</i>, and delivered on board his ship with promptitude
and dispatch, at the usual market rates.</p>

<p>The new plan was pronounced kapai (good), and
gave universal satisfaction. Not only did it encourage
a noble and national art, but the revenue
of the kingdom was thereby largely increased. We
can hardly realize, perhaps, the intense chagrin of
these merry folk when they found that the missionaries
discouraged their laudable efforts in this
direction, not to mention that those teachers also
interdicted the time-honoured custom of anthropophagy.
I have often fancied I heard some
ancient Maori sighing and lamenting for the good
old times, the merry days when he was young!</p>

<p>But, possibly, it is as well that the moku and
the head-curing process should be now among the
number of lost and vanished arts.</p>

<small>MAORI MANNERS.</small></h2>

<p class="center">II.</p>


<p>The Maori tongue is akin to several of the South
Sea dialects. The language of the distant Sandwich
Islands corresponds most nearly to it. A Maori
and a Hawaiian can understand one another to a
great extent. It is strange that intervening groups
should be inhabited by people of wholly different
races, who speak in altogether different tongues.</p>

<p>For ordinary colloquial purposes a sufficiency of
Maori is readily acquired, though those who study
it deeply discover many difficulties. The alphabet
contains only fourteen letters, consequently the
sound of many words, expressing wholly distinct
ideas, is frequently confusingly similar. The grammar
is not overcharged with those bugbears of
childhood&mdash;moods, tenses, and declensions. The
tone and inflection of the voice are used to convey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
a varied meaning to the same word, in many instances.
A sentence will have different significations
according to the inflection used in uttering it,
and to the gestures that accompany it. The idiom
is singular, but rather graceful.</p>

<p>The written language has been constructed by
the missionaries and others, as has been done with
various other tongues in Polynesia and elsewhere.
Bibles and sundry more books have been translated
and printed in Maori. In fact, there is beginning to
be quite a Maori literature, for, besides translations,
there have been published several volumes of Maori
legends, proverbs, songs, etc., and there are two or
three journals regularly issued in the language.</p>

<p>Most of the rising generation are able to read
and write in their own tongue, if not in English
also; for they all have been, or go, to school. They
cannot readily articulate all our sounds, but education
is doing much to remedy this; also, they are
rather inclined to adhere to their own idiom, which
is, of course, to be expected. Very few of the elder
Maori have these Pakeha accomplishments, or care
to exercise them. A queer pride and prejudice keep
them from attempting to learn or speak English.
But I have found that a good many of them know
a great deal more than they are disposed to allow.</p>

<p>The ancient Maori would seem to have had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
some notion of hieroglyphic or picture-writing. The
moku is one example of this, and others are to
be found in the symbolic carvings of door-lintels
and of standard posts, inscriptions on rocks and
trees, and the sacred whalebone staves of the
tohunga, whereon were kept a genealogical record
of the families of high rank.</p>

<p>Oral tradition was well kept up among the
Maori, and certain of them may be termed deep
scholars in it. They are a long-winded race, and
very great at a korero (talk or debate), without
which nothing was or can be done. They can reel
off immeasurable quantities of legendary history
or romance, in prose and verse, having astounding
memories for this sort of thing. Oratory was cultivated
as an art by them, and many are remarkably
eloquent; but the style of their orations principally
consists in the recitation of proverbs and traditions,
and the application of them to affairs of the moment.
Sir George Grey is, perhaps, more intimately acquainted
with these things, and with the Maori
language, than any other Pakeha, and he has collected
and published some of their poems and
sayings.</p>

<p>Decidedly the most noteworthy Maori institution
was that of the tapu. It exists in various forms
throughout the South Sea. There is the tambu of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Fiji, and the tabu of other islands, essentially the
same thing. But it was among the Maori that it
appears to have been brought to its greatest perfection.
We have drawn from it our word <i>taboo</i>,
which we use to express anything that is rigidly forbidden
or disallowed. But the Maori tapu went
far deeper than that. To use the words of another
writer, "it comprised everything that we would call
law, custom, etiquette, prejudice, and superstition,
and had therefore its good as well as its bad effects."</p>

<p>Except in some of its superstitious aspects, the
tapu is now a thing of the past, and is spoken of
here as such. I have not studied the subject very
deeply, but have picked up enough knowledge of
it to enable me to give a general idea of what it was.</p>

<p>Tapu appeared under many different phases, and
was intimately connected with all the concerns of
life. A river was tapu at certain well-known
seasons, thus providing a close time for the fish.
No person might disturb it in any way; no one
might fish or bathe in it; nor might a canoe venture
upon its surface until the tapu was removed.</p>

<p>A wood was tapu, in like manner, when birds
were nesting, tawhera fruit maturing, or rats multiplying.
This was in effect a game-law. Similarly,
the fields and gardens, the cultivations of kumera
and taro, used not to be fenced until the introduc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>tion
of pigs rendered that necessary. Human trespassers
were kept off by means of the inviolable
tapu. Burglars and thieves were prevented from
entering empty houses, or from appropriating property,
by the same simple means.</p>

<p>The application of the tapu was exceedingly
simple. A carved and painted rod was stuck up;
a bunch of flax was prominently displayed; a rag
from the person, a bone, a bunch of hair set in some
conspicuous situation, any of these were sufficient
indications of the awful mystery. But to remove
the tapu was a wholly different matter. That could
not be done so easily. In all cases of importance
a whole ritual had to be gone through before the
tapu could be lifted. Ceremonies of high import
were sometimes necessary, even a sort of propitiatory
sacrifice seems occasionally to have been made.
The karakia, a kind of invocation or prayer, had to
be uttered with due solemnity, and this necessitated
the intervention of the tohunga.</p>

<p>Here let me explain who this personage was.
Like poets, the tohunga was born, not made. What
gave him his particular sanctity or dignity, how he
was chosen, set apart, or elected to office, are things
that no Pakeha can understand. They are sublime
and fearful mysteries, into which not even the
greatest friend of the Maori has ever been able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
penetrate. All we have ever learnt regarding the
tohunga is simply that there he <i>was</i>, the acknowledged
priest, prophet, seer, sorcerer, medical man,
judge and jury, executioner, and general adviser of
the tribe, while also being the grand vizier of the
chief, if indeed he was not the chief himself. He
might belong to any class. He might be an ariki
(sovereign), a tana (noble), a rangatira (gentleman),
or one of the commonalty. He might even be a
kuki (slave), or, as has been known, a wahine
(woman). This, then, was the individual with whom
rested the imposition or lifting of the tapu, in all
the more solemn cases, and he was the arbiter and
arranger of all its various and intricate modes of
application.</p>

<p>The penalties for infringement of tapu depended
upon the particular phase of it that was broken.
Often instant death was dealt out to offenders; it
was inevitable in all important cases. But slighter
punishment was sufficient in instances of a less
comprehensive kind. Tapu was rarely broken
except through accident or ignorance, for dark and
gloomy horrors of a spectral kind hovered round it
in Maori imagination. Yet if tapu was infringed,
neither ignorance of it, nor unavoidable accident was
held to be the slightest excuse. Bloody massacres
have taken place, and furious wars been waged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
simply to avenge some unintentional breach of
tapu.</p>

<p>No notion of chastity seems to have belonged
to Maori women. They were children of nature,
and by no means prudish. Whilst young and free,
unengaged to any gentleman, a Maori girl was permitted
to have as many followers as she liked, and
she was not exactly what we should term virtuous.
If pretty she was a general pet in the kainga, and
a merry time she had of it. One of the ordinary
rules of hospitality as practised in a Maori village,
still not entirely obsolete in some places, proves the
engaging openness of manners and unrestricted
freedom which prevailed socially. The number of
half-breed children occasionally seen about a kainga,
show the easy way in which certain Pakeha have
fallen in with Maori customs.</p>

<p>But tapu provided a marriage law of singular
stringency. So soon as a girl was married, nay,
merely betrothed, no more license for her. She
was tapu to her husband, and if the terrors of the
unseen world should not be enough to keep her in
the straight path, death was the penalty for the
slightest deviation therefrom. She was the slave
as well as the wife of her lord, and this continued
until, and sometimes even after, his death, unless
he should permit a sort of formal divorce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>The person of an ariki was highly tapu. The
sublime essence rested, if anywhere, most particularly
in his head. His hair might not be cut or dressed
without the observance of most formal etiquette. It
was a fearful breach of tapu to pass anything over
or above his head. Any man was tapu, or unclean,
if he were wounded, sick, or undergoing the moku.
He might not enter a house, or eat food with his
hands. But an ariki in this condition was, of course,
tapu in much higher degree. One such dignitary,
entering the canoe of another person, accidentally
scratched his toe with a splinter. Blood flowing
from the wound made the boat tapu, and it thereby
became the property of the chief. The owner surrendered
at once, not even dreaming of complaint.</p>

<p>Burial places were naturally tapu. A Maori of
the olden time would rather die than break their
sanctity; and his descendants of the present day
have hardly got over the feeling. They were called
wahi tapu, and no one dared to enter them. The
tohunga and his assistants passed within them to bury
the dead, but only with much karakia and ceremony.
Spirits of some kind were supposed to keep watch
and ward over them, and to wreak terrible vengeance
upon trespassers. Water flowing from a wahi tapu
was sacred, and whatever it touched became tinctured
with the same dread property. Rather a nuisance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
sometimes, one would think, such as when a storm
of rain should send a new watercourse from some
wahi tapu on a hill-side down into the river, or
through the kainga. Either would thus be rendered
tapu, and have to be deserted at once.</p>

<p>Certain lands, at the present day, cannot be
bought from their Maori owners because of wahi
tapu upon them. It will be remembered that our
show-place is in this category. There is a wahi
tapu, a cavern in this instance, near the Bay of
Islands, that will yield treasure-trove to curio-hunters
some day. With the bodies of the dead were placed
their arms, valuables, and personals generally.
There is said to be a great store of such riches in
this place. Of course, no Maori will go very near
it, and the few Pakeha of the district who know its
whereabouts would not break the tapu, having too
much to lose, and not caring to risk Maori wrath.</p>

<p>In the earliest days of intercourse with Europeans,
the tapu was sometimes made useful in
business; useful, that is, to the Maori, but certainly
not to the trader. For instance, a Sydney vessel
sails into Hokianga, or some other river, and is
boarded by the ariki of the neighbourhood. This
gentleman is perfectly satisfied with the trader's
goods, but cannot agree as to the price to be paid
for them in pigs, lumber, and flax. The Pakeha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
wants so much; the Maori offers so little. Long
chaffering results in no better understanding. At
length the chief departs indignantly, previously
putting the tapu upon the ship and her cargo. No
other natives will now approach or do business;
even other tribes will not infringe the tapu. If the
skipper wished to sail off to some other part, he
could not do so, except by risking a battle, or spoiling
his chances of future trade. Generally, he would
come to terms with the chief, after an exasperating
delay.</p>

<p>The mana (power) of an ariki was very great;
and, in a lesser degree the next ranks, the tana and
rangatira, possessed it also. As there was little or
nothing externally to distinguish the greatest of
chiefs from the meanest of his subjects, "the dignity
that doth hedge a king" was conferred and kept up
by the mysterious agencies of the tapu. Possibly
this was a good reason for its universal supremacy.</p>

<p>The tapu descended into the commonest details
of daily life, and it reached to the most solemn and
obscurest depths of the Maori mythology. It was a
law&mdash;a code of laws, based on superstition, elaborated
with diplomatic skill, enforced by human justice,
universally and entirely accepted, and in its most
important aspects was invested with the grimmest
terrors of the unseen world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>A Maori would certainly rather die than enter
the precincts of a wahi tapu; his terrors would
probably kill him if he were so much as touched
by a ngarara, or little green lizard. Incredible as
it may seem, the Maori were indeed sometimes
killed by fear. Instances are on record of individuals
who have unknowingly violated the tapu,
in some one of its important phases. No one else
might be aware of the crime, so that the culprit
would have nothing to dread from human justice.
But he has been so absolutely terror-stricken, that
he has gone straight away into the bush, laid down,
and died there.</p>

<p>Everything about an ariki was invested with a
sacred mystery. His clothes, weapons, ornaments,
or house could not even be touched by the inferior.
He must eat alone, could not carry food, could not
blow the fire, could not do many things, lest his tapu
should unwittingly slay some unfortunate person, or
his mana become impaired.</p>

<p>The law of the tapu made government possible
among the Maori, and bound them together in their
tribes; just as the law of Moses made government
possible among the Hebrews. Indeed, in many of
its applications the tapu is strangely similar to the
Jewish code. Sometimes it may seem ridiculous to
us in certain of its forms, so do many of our customs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
seem ridiculous to the Maori. The other day, one
of the Maori members of the House of Representatives
rose in his place to oppose a motion for an
hour's adjournment of business. He said that the
Pakeha system of adjourning for refreshment every
now and then was a ridiculous one. Honourable
members went and got more or less drunk&mdash;so the
Maori alleged&mdash;and then returned only to wrangle
or go to sleep. It would be better to conclude the
business on hand, and do the drinking afterwards,
observed this sapient legislator. Some "teetotallers'"
organ, commenting on the incident, said
"his remarks actually shamed the House into
decent behaviour for a day or two."</p>

<p>The early missionaries made a dead set against
the tapu as a heathen custom, and herein, I think,
their policy was a mistaken one. But its whole
working was not known to them at that period,
and, besides that, it caused them no inconsiderable
annoyance. The following story is recorded&mdash;by a
writer who was himself one of the missionaries&mdash;of
the first serious blow that heathenism received in
New Zealand, and from which originated the acceptance
of Christianity by all the tribes of the Maori.</p>

<p>An early party of missionaries had settled at
Keri-keri, in the Bay of Islands district, and were
on friendly terms with the natives. But when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
customary tapu of the Keri-keri river was in force,
it caused the mission people great annoyance. The
river was their only road, and they could not now
pass up or down it; their communications with Te
Puna, the principal mission centre in the bay itself,
were thus stopped. Stores were required, and at
last, in defiance of the native tradition, the mission
boat was manned and rowed down the river, thus
breaking through the inviolable tapu.</p>

<p>The rage and terror of the Maori were excessive,
as may be supposed, and they looked to see the
outraged atua (spirits) exterminate the rash Pakeha.
But nothing happened, so the Maori determined to
avenge the insult themselves, as their fathers had
done on Du Fresne, for a very similar violation of
tapu. They seized the mission boat on its return,
and tied up its occupants preparatory to killing and
eating them. Then a whole tribe divided the
boat's cargo among themselves.</p>

<p>Now, it so chanced that the bulk of the stores,
which the boat was bringing up from Te Puna to
Keri-keri, consisted of two items: pots and tins
of preserves of different kinds, and a supply of
medicines. The Maori devoured the first greedily,
and then, as they did not know what else the drugs
could be intended for, out of a mere sense of consistency
they swallowed salts, jalap, ipecacuanha,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
castor oil, and so on, as greedily and copiously as
they had the jams and pickles.</p>

<p>The result may readily be imagined. Dire prostration
of that unhappy tribe. Instant release of
the captives, amid the grovellings and supplications
of the now anguished and disordered Maori.
Triumphant and unexpected victory of the missionary
mana. That tribe became instant converts,
and were received into the fold of the Church.
Had not the missionaries broken through the
dreaded tapu unharmed? And had not the
avengers of their insulted deities been visited with
strange and awful punishment for their presumption
in daring to meddle with these Pakeha?
What further evidence was needed to demonstrate
the superiority of the missionaries over all the
Maori gods and devils?</p>

<p>Most strange, too, is another circumstance that
operated to the same end. The Maori had oracles,
or some kind of divination that was practised by the
tohunga. Again and again were these oracles consulted,
as to whether the Pakeha religion or the
Maori mythology was best worthy of belief. The
answer was invariable&mdash;so the missionaries tell us.
It declared Jesus Christ to be the only true God.
So the tapu Maori was set aside; and, little by
little, the tapu Pakeha, or Christianity, replaced it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>At the present day all Maori are professed
Christians, and, as a rule, very earnest ones. Among
the younger there is a state of mind more approaching
to our standards, but with the elders it is different.
They were born under a different <i>régime</i>. Their
young minds were filled with hereditary impressions
that conversion has been naturally powerless to
shake off altogether. Their vague and foggy mythology
is still believed in, though they formulate their
notion of it in Scriptural words and phrases.</p>

<p>They have long laid aside the old habits of war
and cannibalism, but political necessity brought this
about, quite as much as Christianity. And the old
warlike spirit is by no means dead, any more than
the dark and gloomy mysteries of the ancient belief.
These crop out sometimes from beneath the veneer
of the newer mental garment.</p>

<p>It was believed that the spirits of the dead&mdash;of
the good dead, the brave warrior dead, apparently&mdash;had
a long and toilsome journey before them. They
had to cross mountains and marshes, and to find
their way through forests and over rivers. Many
terrible difficulties had to be encountered, and all
sorts of spirit foes were ready to contest the narrow
path. At last the end of the earth was reached,
Cape Reinga, in the extreme north. An awfully
tapu place this to living Maori. Here came the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
spirits of the dead at last, after accomplishing their
journey, beset as it had been with many perils. And
from the top of Cape Reinga, a mighty rock projecting
into the sea, they took their last look at earth
and dived into the water. Then they had to swim
out beyond the Three Kings Islands, where the gate
of Paradise was supposed to be situated.</p>

<p>Many a tattooed Christian cannot give up his
belief in this idea, and he still retains it, reconciling
it in some dim way with his new theology.</p>

<p>There is a little emerald-green lizard in the bush,
called by the Maori ngarara. It is dreadfully tapu,
and an old warrior would rather die than touch it.
It is believed to contain a spirit, some say an evil
demon, others the ghost of a wicked man. There is
some uncertainty on that point, even among the
most learned tohunga. At any rate it is most excessively
tapu. It seems that to throw a ngarara at
a Maori, or even to bring it near him, or show it to
him, is a crime of a very heinous character. Wars
were the consequence of such acts, once upon a time.
I did not know of this superstition regarding the
ngarara, and nearly lost my life in consequence. At
least, I have been told the case was as bad as that.</p>

<p>This was the way of it. Once, when engaged in
land-surveying, I had a gang of Maori workmen, to
cut the lines through the bush and do the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
work of the party. Among these were two or
three half-breeds, youngish men, and a couple of old
moku Maori, with others. The two old fellows
always struck me as being more like Irishmen of
the peasant class than anything else. They always
had some whimsical joke or another, there was a
normally comic look in their faces, and they possessed
that quaint affectation of childishness, and love of
laughter, which are proverbially characteristic of the
Irish peasant.</p>

<p>We had been some weeks out, and had got on
very well together. Like all the others, the two old
boys were remarkably pious. They had a sort of
Bible-class and prayer-meeting every night and
morning in the camp. I used to call them "the two
apostles," because their baptismal names happened
to be Pita (Peter) and Pora (Paul).</p>

<p>One day, when we were all at work on the line,
I happened to pick up a pretty little ngarara. Without
thinking of what I was doing, I held it out to
Pita and Pora, who were nearest to me, asking them
what it was, and finally I threw it lightly towards
them, saying, "Catch!"</p>

<p>The two apostles became suddenly transformed.
They yelled, they screeched, they leapt and danced,
they chanted the terrific war-song of their tribe.
Never shall I forget the sudden and fierce convul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>sion
that completely changed every feature of their
faces and bodies. I no longer knew my two
apostles, they had changed into demoniac savages
in a whirlwind of wrath.</p>

<p>I stood admiringly watching them, never supposing
this exhibition was real, but imagining it was
simply a new joke got up for my behoof. The two
came gradually closer towards me, clashing their
axes together, and seeming like a pair of ferocious
panthers. But I noticed that the rest of the gang
had stopped work and were looking on. They were
not laughing, but seemed excited and concerned.
Then it occurred to me that something was not
right, and that it would be as well to withdraw.</p>

<p>Just as Pita and Pora were brandishing their
axes within a few feet of me, yelling and dancing, or
rather bounding, towards me, the two half-breeds
rushed swiftly past them and threw themselves
between us. Without a word they seized me by the
arms and dragged me into the thicket. Then they
explained, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Run for your life! They mean to kill you!"</p>

<p>When I rejoined the working-party an hour or
two later, Pita and Pora were calm again, and had
resumed their work. They merely growled and
menaced me. Afterwards, when we were lying side
by side in camp, Pita reverted to the matter as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
pleasant episode. He told me all about the ngarara,
how tapu it was, and what a dreadful insult I had
unwittingly put upon him and his mate. He said
they would certainly have killed me in their wild
gust of passion, though they would have been sorry
for it afterwards. It was all over now, he added,
because he and Pora had had time to reflect, and
remembered that I was a poor ignorant Pakeha who
knew no better. Besides, they were Christians,
which they had forgotten in their heat. Now, they
were my two apostles once more. I understand
that Pora alluded feelingly to the matter during an
exposition of the Scriptures, with which he favoured
the rest of the gang the following Sunday.</p>

<p>At the present day, the rites and ceremonies of
the tohunga have entirely given place to Christian
observances; and, as is the wont of primitive
intelligences, the Maori are most rigorous observers
of all outward forms, whatever degree of fervour they
may have spiritually attained. In the young days
of Christianity here, the converts ascribed to the
missionaries a magical mana, such as they had
formerly believed to reside in the tohunga. This
was the natural result of that terrible day of wrath
on the Keri-keri, when a "great awakening" was
brought about through the instrumentality and
efficacy of Epsom salts, and when the mana of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
tapu Pakeha was thereby so fully demonstrated.
Consequently, the ceremonial prescribed and the
doctrines inculcated by the missionaries were most
unquestioningly accepted.</p>

<p>The Maori adopted religion with a marvellous
zeal, and, had it not been for European colonization,
sectarianism, and other reasons, they might have
become a startling example of fervid Christianity.
The differences between denominations, even in the
early days, created much bitterness, and, as we have
seen, led to Hau-hau. It has needed, at times, all
the mana of the missionary, and more, to prevent
actual hostilities between communities professing
the differing creeds of the Episcopal, Wesleyan,
or Roman Catholic bodies. One often meets with
sad examples of sectarian animosity manifested
among these simple people.</p>

<p>In the early days the missionaries were a political
power. Long before the Treaty of Waitangi was
signed they had attained a supreme and widespread
influence among the tribes. As has been already
noticed, it was their desire to have formed a Christian
Maori nation, under their own ægis; and, to effect
this, they seem to have disregarded the wants of
their own countrymen. But all this is retrospective
matter, with which it is not now necessary to deal.
Neither may I revert to the action of missionaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
in the young days of the colony, either with regard
to the general government, or to the land-sharking
attributed to certain of their number. Too much
acrimony has been given rise to already by the discussion
of such topics.</p>

<p>The missionary influence has now less practical
power, perhaps, than clerical direction in England.
Only among secluded hapu (communities) is anything
resembling the old force to be found, and
there it is necessarily limited and localized. It is
felt more among the elders than among the younger
generations, who have learnt to read and write,
have mixed more with Pakeha, and whose minds
are consequently more open, and less inclined to
accept spiritual authority as absolute. Their conceptions
are not the same as their fathers', to whose
minds Christianity came as a new form of tapu,
and to whom the missionary appeared as possessor
of a more powerful mana than the tohunga.</p>

<p>Sunday is a kind of tapu day with the Maori.
They are often more Sabbatarian than Scotsmen,
and more pharisaic than the Pharisees themselves.
To the letter of the law they pay the minutest
attention, whether they estimate its spirit rightly
or not.</p>

<p>But there is great diversity of character in this
as in other matters, and what is recorded of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
tribe or community will not always apply to all.
The perfect equality with the Pakeha that the Maori
enjoy, and the degree of education that has grown
up among them, have produced effects. Among
others is a gradual change from fervour to hypocrisy,
and from an exaggerated piety to a lesser regard
for the forms of religion. Year by year fewer tales
will be told of Maori affectations, simple pieties, or
childish formalism.</p>

<p>Religion is often the fashion in some of their
communities, and is entertained with the most rigid
observance. Travellers coming to a Maori kainga
upon a Sunday, have been denied shelter and food
until sunrise on Monday; and, when Monday
came, they have been cheated by the same tattooed
Pharisees, who were too sanctimonious to sell a
potato to a hungry traveller upon the Sabbath, or
to help him build a hut as shelter from the wind
and rain.</p>

<p>Maori look upon a money collection in church
as a part of the ceremony, on no account to be
omitted. The service, they think, is incomplete
without it. But they will not give more than one
penny, on any account whatever. The warden, who
is taking round the plate, has to make change for
numerous sixpences, shillings, and even notes (£1)
in the course of his progress through the church, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
order that the Maori may give their pennies&mdash;no
more and no less. If a man or woman cannot raise
a penny, he or she will usually stop away from
church altogether, rather than be remiss in the important
ceremony of putting a copper in the plate.
In the rare case, when one is found in church without
possessing a copper to give, he will <i>make believe</i> to
put something in the plate when it comes to him,
and&mdash;by way, I suppose, of strengthening the deception&mdash;will
make a horrible grimace at the collector.</p>

<p>There are many very quaint scenes to be witnessed
in connection with a Maori church, which,
until they were used to them, must have sorely tried
the gravity of the missionaries and the white part
of the congregation. The Maori behave with an
exaggerated decorum and seriousness of deportment
that is in itself sufficiently laughter-provoking,
especially since their eyes are always roving stealthily
round to see who is observing them. They sing
with such earnestness that at times it almost amounts
to fury; and they join in the responses with loud
and emphatic fervour. They will weep abundantly
and noisily when moved thereto by certain prayers,
or by pathetic incidents from Scripture history; or
they will laugh uproariously at passages that tickle
their fancy.</p>

<p>Nothing whatever can keep these simple and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
excitable people from showing their feelings, as
aroused by Scripture reading or by the sermon.
They listen to the preacher precisely as they do to
their own traditions, when told by a native story-teller
in the wharè. Their ejaculations are frequent,
and prove the intense and vivid interest they take
in the stories told them. I have seen a church-ful
of Maori grinding their teeth, stamping their feet,
waving their arms, and actually raging, when the
treachery of Judas was being related to them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I have seen the same people
violently nodding their heads, grinning with appreciation,
exclaiming kapai! (good), and showing
thorough approbation, over the somewhat questionable
business transactions of the patriarch Jacob
with Esau and Laban. The stories of Daniel and
the lions, and of the other young men who were
thrown into the fiery furnace, are high favourites
with the Maori. The lions' den finds a parallel in
their own mythology, and is recognized by them as
being meant for the mysterious cave of the Taniwha,
or gigantic lizard-dragon, of which they possess
legends.</p>

<p>Dress is a most important item of Sunday ceremony
among the Maori, and it is astonishing how
well they will turn out. In the seclusion of their
own kainga they frequently lay aside civilized attire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
and are seen either quite naked, or only loosely
enveloped in a dirty blanket; but elsewhere they
usually wear shirt and trousers, much the same as
settlers. To go to church, as also on high-days
and holidays, they appear in wonderfully correct
costume; for most Maori have earned money enough,
at one time or another, with which to rig themselves
out at the stores. Coats of broadcloth, alpaca, or
light silk; snowy shirt-collars and cuffs; dangling
watch-chains, with perhaps a bouquet in the buttonhole,
and a bright-coloured satin scarf; "billy-cock"
or "wide-awake" hats, white cork helmets, or possibly
even a "chimney-pot" hat; accurate trousers
and unquestionable boots; in such guise does the
Maori rangatira of the present day saunter into
church, side by side with the far less well-got-up
English-born New Zealand gentleman.</p>

<p>Only one item of the old barbaric splendour&mdash;besides
the moku on the face&mdash;is retained, and that
is nearly always seen; namely, the earrings and
ornaments. These are prominent features, and their
size causes them to be well displayed. The ear
ornaments are of considerable variety. A polished
slip of greenstone (jade), about six or eight inches in
length, is most highly thought of. Then there are
dog's teeth, boar's tusks, polished shells and pebbles,
bunches of soft white feathers like marabouts, fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
flowers, and yards upon yards of streaming ribbon.
But this ornamentation is not unsightly, though at
first it may seem somewhat incongruous with the
rest of the costume. Some of us used to discuss
the advisability of decorating our own ears in the
same way, with a view, perhaps, of looking more
attractive in the eyes of the Maori maidens.</p>

<p>The Maori young ladies are not, perhaps, strikingly
beautiful&mdash;our Rakope always excepted&mdash;but
they have good features, plump, graceful figures, and
an altogether comely and agreeable <i>tout ensemble</i>.
Their white teeth and juicy lips, sparkling eyes and
dimpling cheeks, ever-ready smiles and roguish
glances, make them a very pleasant sight to see.
One loses all distaste for the brown complexion,
and even for the two or three lines of moku on
the chin, though most of the present generation
are without those marks.</p>

<p>The dress of a Maori girl, under ordinary circumstances,
is a print frock and nothing else, unless
it be a straw hat. But, like the gentlemen, she can
come out a grand swell sometimes. You may see
all the latest Auckland fashions in a Maori church.
The general run of the girls' costume is a dress of
calico or some similar stuff, clean and well put together,
with a tartan shawl of the most vivid hues over the
shoulders, a jaunty hat decorated with flowers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
feathers, and a general profusion of natural flowers
and fluttering ribbons in the flowing hair. Boots
and socks are worn on such occasions, much to the
wearers' discomfort, I believe.</p>

<p>But the rangatira girls have learnt from the
Pakeha ladies to indulge a passion for fine clothes, and
it is seldom that they do not find means to gratify
their vanity. A Maori <i>young lady</i>&mdash;for the rangatira
hold themselves as of gentle blood at the very least&mdash;has
several ways open to her of acquiring sufficient
pin-money to place her wardrobe on a proper footing.
The first and easiest method is evidently to
worry "papa" into selling some of his land; but
the Maori paterfamilias is not always pleased to
allow his daughters to interfere with his own peculiar
line of business.</p>

<p>Of course miss declines to go out to service as
a domestic in any settler's family, even if she were
fitted for such a post&mdash;that is menial work, and
suitable only for the inferior kuki girls. But she
does not always object to do open-air labour about
a farm, dig potatoes and kumera, reap and shell
maize, assist among the flocks at shearing time, and
take a job of humping. Often she will go gum-digging
or flax-picking&mdash;one or other of these is her
favourite means of raising the wind, unless she can
find a market for fish, fruit, or eggs. Any way, get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
money she must, and will, and does, somehow or
another, and on Sundays and gala-days she will
appear at church or at the settlement arrayed in a
style that would do credit to Regent Street.</p>

<p>At our bush-balls the Maori girls appear in
muslins, ribbons, silks, and laces&mdash;though these may
not always be of the cleanest or newest. And I
have even seen silk stockings&mdash;white or pink, with
"clocks" up the sides&mdash;and sandal-shoes upon their
feet.</p>

<p>Nor is our modern Maori belle merely a dressed-up
savage. Educated at the mission or government
schools, she can always read and write in Maori,
and often in English better than she can speak it.
She has some idea of elementary arithmetic, geography,
and history, and can use a needle and
thread, study the English fashion-books, and sometimes
even use her pencil and draw a little. Still,
I am bound to say, all these improvements are
but superficial; the Maori blood is in the girl and
is bound to show itself, however far advanced may
be her education.</p>

<p>Whilst young and unmarried, and even in the
early days of matrimony, the Maori girl's life is
happy enough. She is petted and caressed by
everybody, particularly if more than ordinarily
comely; but in the after years she becomes a beast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of burden, a hewer of wood and drawer of water,
an inferior being, who may be soundly thrashed
when her lord considers it good to do so. And
the less said about the older women the better;
they rapidly pass through every degree of homeliness,
until they at last attain to a surpassing and
appalling hideousness. In the best and foremost
of the Maori girls of the period there is a constant
struggle between the acquired Pakeha refinements
and the primitive habits of the kainga. This leads
to many ludicrous scenes, two instances of which
I will describe.</p>

<p>One Sunday I saw the young and handsome
daughter of a chief of some rank stepping out of
church, and got up to death in a costume that was
evidently the result of a recent visit to Auckland
itself. For the benefit of my lady readers I will
try to describe her dress&mdash;so far as an ex-bushman
may essay such a task.</p>

<p>Her robe was of pale green silk, adorned with
lace trimmings, darker green fringes, and pale pink
satin borderings. It had a panier and train, and
was shaped and fitted with great taste, and as a
fashionable milliner might turn it out. The lady
wore cuffs and collar of white lace, with pink satin
bows, also a gorgeous cameo brooch, a gold watch-chain,
and lavender kid gloves. Her head was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
adorned with a wide-brimmed white hat, high-crowned,
and having one side looped up. It was
ornamented with dark green velvet, some gay
artificial flowers, a stuffed humming-bird, and a long
drooping ostrich feather. Her hair was elaborately
dressed in the latest type of chignon; in one hand
she carried a gorgeous parasol, all ribbons and
fringes and lace, and in the other she had a large
feathery fan; while from beneath the white edge of
her petticoat two pretty little boots peeped out.</p>

<p>Of course my lady was the cynosure of all eyes,
and her delighted vanity was boundless. She
minced and rustled down the pathway like a
peacock, utterly disdaining all her kindred, male
and female, and immensely proud of her own
"Englishness." She tossed her head and twisted
herself about as a child would do, and wore on her
face a chronic smile of supreme self-contentment,
while her eyes were wandering all about to note
the effect her grandeur was producing.</p>

<p>As her ladyship would not condescend to let
any one speak to her, so grand and dignified did
she feel, it happened that, when she got to the outskirts
of the settlement, she found herself alone, and
then, I suppose, her assumption of Englishness
suddenly left her. One or two of us had stolen
after her, keeping hidden among the bushes at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the side of the road, and thence witnessing what
followed.</p>

<p>Presently appeared on the scene two or three
old Maori women, horrible, repulsive-looking hags,
scantily draped in the filthiest and most ragged of
blankets, their brows thatched with disgusting
masses of hair and dirt. These witches gathered
round the young belle, loudly expressing their
admiration, and fingering over her Pakeha attire.
Then her ladyship experienced a sudden revulsion
of feeling, and returned all at once to the level of
common humanity. Relinquishing all her airs and
graces, she whipped up her silken skirts, squatted
down on her hams, drew out a short black pipe,
and, cheek-by-jowl with her ancient compatriots,
enjoyed a hearty smoke, while relating with great
animation the events of the morning.</p>

<p>On another occasion I was riding down to the
Bay of Islands, when I came up behind a couple
who were riding leisurely along in the same direction.
Save and except their shaggy, ungroomed
horses, they might have just ridden out of Hyde
Park into the middle of that wild country. One was
a lady, attired in an elegant, blue, velveteen riding-habit,
with hat and feather to match, and with silky
brown hair falling over her shoulders down to her
horse's croup. Her cavalier, from the top of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
white helmet down to his spurred boot-heels, was
got up with considerably more regard to effect than
is ordinarily seen in the bush.</p>

<p>And there was a good deal of spooning going
on, apparently, though that is not so uncommon
when couples ride out together, even in the bush.
The gentleman was carrying the lady's parasol and
other paraphernalia, was leaning over, holding her
hand, looking into her eyes, and all the rest of it.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" I thought to myself, "that will be
Miss Dash, I presume, whom the Blanks expected
to visit them. And who is the fellow, I wonder!"</p>

<p>So I rode quickly after them, coming up without
attracting attention, my horse's unshod hoofs making
scarcely any noise on the soft road. To my amazement,
the amorous pair turned out to be Henere
Tangiao, a half-breed, who had been the foreman
of a gang of native labourers I had lately discharged;
and his fair companion was his very recent bride,
formerly Miss Mata Akepiro.</p>

<p>They greeted me with great cordiality, only a
little overcome by self-consciousness of their "store-clothes,"
that had been donned to do honour to some
settlers they had been to visit. Said Mrs. Tangiao
to me, showing her pretty teeth, and with only a
little more Maori accent than I am able to reproduce&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"You come see our house, Mitta Hay; you
come see old Maori kainga at Matapa? You come
plenty plenty soon, good!"</p>

<p>I accepted the invitation, and did go some days
after that. The house was a little wooden cottage,
built outside the enclosed kainga of raupo wharè,
or reed-grass cabins, of the rest of the tribe. It was
a wharè Pakeha, built by Henere in right of the
admixture of English blood in his veins, and not,
I truly believe, from any preference for that style
of building over the old Maori kind.</p>

<p>There was no one about when I arrived, so I
walked through the two rooms and out at the back.
The rooms were furnished with a few tables and
chairs and other things, much after the style of
married settlers in a small way. Out behind the
house was an open space, where a fire was burning,
with a billy boiling upon it. Close to the fire,
superintending the cooking, her hair hanging in
elf-locks round her head and over her face, squatting
on the ground with her chin on her knees, a pipe
in her mouth, and a dirty blanket over her shoulders
as her only garment, was Mrs. Tangiao, the lady of
the riding-habit.</p>

<p>Naturally, you would suppose that such an
elegant and civilized young bride would blush with
shame and dismay at being discovered by me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
such utter <i>déshabillé</i>. Not a bit of it! Up she
jumped, all smiles and welcomes, her blanket falling
off as she did so, and leaving her as naked as a
mahogany Venus. Even this did not discompose
her in the least, as she warmly shook hands with
me, and with truly childlike innocence offered her
lips for a fraternal salute.</p>

<p>But the most comical part of the whole affair is
yet to be told. A hearty coo-ee or two brought up
Henere, who was at work in his cultivation at no
great distance. After he had shaken me by the
hand and warmly welcomed me, he began to scold
the unlucky Mata. Not on the score of indelicacy
or indecency, though; no such thought as that
crossed his brain, good easy man! He only reproved
his wife for not showing sufficient and
proper honour to her "rangatira Pakeha" guest,
which could not be done, he considered, unless she
were completely attired in full Pakeha costume.</p>

<p>So, while I sat on the verandah and sipped some
tea, Henere commenced to dress up his bride before
my very eyes. He put on and fastened every
article of her best clothes, combed and brushed out
her redundant hair, decked and ornamented her
with all the ribbons and laces and so on of which
her wardrobe could boast. Meanwhile, the lady
remained quite passive under his hands, sitting or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
standing or turning about as required, but all the
while with serious unmoved expression of face, and
puckered-up lips. Her large wondering eyes she
kept fixed intently upon me, to note the effect the
processes of her toilette were having upon me. I
was very nearly strangled with suppressed laughter,
but it would have mortally offended these simple,
earnest people to have shown the least sense of the
ridiculous.</p>

<p>When all was finished, and Mrs. Tangiao was
costumed in English fashion, and very nicely, too,
let me say, her husband made her enter the sitting-room
and sit down upon a chair. Then he turned
to me, unbounded satisfaction visible in his beaming
face, inflated breast, and gesturing hands.</p>

<p>"You come see common Maori, sah? You come
find Pakeha gentleman, Pakeha lady, Pakeha house!
Good, good! Now you sit talk to my missee, I get
Pakeha dinner."</p>

<p>After the meal we took a stroll through the
kainga, Mata trying to attitudinize after the fashion
of the white ladies she had seen in the settlements;
and Henere loftily informing his neighbours that
"<i>We three Pakeha</i> come to see <i>your</i> Maori town"&mdash;a
piece of humour that was thoroughly enjoyed
by both men and women, who made great capital
for numberless jokes out of it.</p>

<small>MAORI MANNERS.</small></h2>

<p class="center">III.</p>


<p>Half-breeds, or Anglo-Maori men and women,
form no inconsiderable section of the native community.
Some have said of them, that they inherit
the vices of both their parents, and the virtues of
neither, but I cannot say that my own observation
goes to support such a sweeping allegation. I have
had some good friends among the Anglo-Maori,
and never noticed any predominant vice in their
character at all.</p>

<p>In complexion and general appearance, the
Anglo-Maori resemble Spaniards or Italians, though
they possess more or less marked traits of either
the English or the Maori blood that mixes in their
veins. Their physique is usually good, though they
incline to slenderness and delicacy. They are by
no means to be stigmatized as idle, but their capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
for work seems less than that of either parent.
They lack the shrewdness of the Maori, and have
not the mental power of the Anglo-Saxon. When
a half-breed is bad, he seems to be wholly so, without
any redeeming good qualities.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Maori women are nearly all very
graceful and good-looking. There are some among
them that are only to be described in the strongest
language, as exceedingly beautiful. I have met a
voluptuous beauty of this mixed race, an educated
and fashionable lady, whose rare and exquisite loveliness
might have made her the cause and heroine
of another Trojan war. Once I knew one who
possessed the most magnificent hair I ever expect
to see.</p>

<p>We were playing croquet, I remember, some
half a dozen people. The ladies had been bathing,
I think; at any rate, they wore their hair flowing
loose. I never saw anything like it. She, my
partner in the game, had a complete mantle of dark-brown
silky tresses. Her hair fell in volumes round
her, and actually trailed on the ground when she
stood upright. What an advertisement she would
have been for a "hair-restorer!"</p>

<p>You know that at croquet one sometimes kneels
to place the balls at a lady's feet, in order that she
may have them in proper position for striking. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
envious wind! It would blow my partner's beautiful
long hair about. And, when performing that kneeling
operation, the hair <i>would</i> come fluttering about
one, and getting entangled round one's neck somehow.
And then, dark tender eyes would look down
with a sweep of velvety lashes, and gaze mockingly
through the silky meshes of unruly floating hair,
and one would be asked in caressing tones&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I'm afraid I've caught you! Have
I, really?"</p>

<p>That game was a dreadfully embarrassing one,
yet quite too delicious and delightfully utter.</p>

<p>Anglo-Maori may be said to be divided into two
distinct classes&mdash;those whose education has been
chiefly or altogether English, and those who have
"tumbled up" in the kainga, in all respects like
Maori. The first are very much the fewest. A
small number have been thoroughly well educated,
perhaps in Sydney or in England, and are in all
respects ladies and gentlemen of the English pattern.
Some of these ladies have married well, into the
best Australian or English society. I am told that
two or three have even secured titles. Their beauty
and sprightliness would cause them to be an ornament
to any society. But the bulk of the Anglo-Maori
are more like my friend Henere Tangiao, not
appreciably different from the pure Maori among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
whom their lot is cast, save in a more Caucasian
physique and a lighter complexion.</p>

<p>Intermarriage between the races is generally
considered to be a very good and desirable thing
by the Maori. Not that they hold themselves in
any degree inferior to the Pakeha, or think a Maori
girl elevated by wedding one; but they are aware
of their own coming extinction as a race, and they
think that intermarriage might serve to perpetuate
Maori blood. It will be remembered that our native
neighbours in the Kaipara are strongly inclined to
this view.</p>

<p>Settlers look upon mixed marriages with different
feelings. I think that most of us are in favour of
them theoretically, but perhaps a less number care
to regard them from a nearer point of view. There
are some, of course, who are violently opposed to
them in any case. But there is here none of that
<i>caste</i> feeling which prevails in India against the
Eurasians, or in America and the West Indies
against negro admixture.</p>

<p>Nearly all such alliances have been between
Pakeha men and Maori women. There have
been instances of Englishwomen marrying men of
the other race, but they have been very rare, nor
do I recollect any such case myself. An Englishwoman,
even of the lowest class, would find it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
difficult to reconcile herself to the life of the wharè
and to the abject servitude, which is the lot of even
the helpmate of an ariki. The condition in which
they keep their wives is even yet little better than
it used to be in former days. Moreover, there
would always be the fear of polygamy.</p>

<p>Polygamy is not often met with now among the
Maori, yet it is not entirely extinct, though it has
become somewhat unofficial in kind. The missionaries
set their faces against it from the very
first, and made the putting away of his superfluous
wives the condition of a convert's acceptance for
baptism. They seem, indeed, to have carried their
opposition to polygamy to rather too great a length,
forgetting that a new phase of thought, when it
operates practically, should be a gradual growth, if
its effect is to be deep and permanent.</p>

<p>Under the first strong influence of conversion the
Maori readily gave in to missionary insistence in
this matter; but after awhile the old habit reconquered
them. Then came individual relapses into
barbarism, individual antagonism with the missionaries,
and much division and heart-burning. It
would have been better, in my humble opinion, to
have ignored polygamy, or at least not to have
pointed at it so particularly. It would have been
better to have allowed things to remain as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
were, in this respect, and to have relied on bringing
up the young generations to the Christian observance
of matrimony. Indeed, some few missionaries
did adopt a line of action something like this, and
found it the wisest in the long run.</p>

<p>By-and-by, the Maori began to seriously argue
the matter. They took their Bibles, which they
had been taught to regard as the standard of right
and wrong, and asked the missionaries to show them
where polygamy was forbidden. Nay, was it not
divinely sanctioned in many parts of the Old
Testament?</p>

<p>The Maori is naturally an acute reasoner and
casuist, and those missionaries who stood out so
emphatically against polygamy now found themselves
worsted on their own ground. The arguments that
have prevailed throughout Christendom in favour of
monogamy were not accepted by the Maori. They
wanted direct Biblical ordinance, and as that was
not forthcoming they assumed that polygamy was
lawful, or, at least, some of them chose to do so.
Then there was great joy. There were marriages
and giving in marriage, after the good old custom.
Probably, this controversy on the matrimonial question
was one of the causes that afterwards eventuated
in Hau-hau.</p>

<p>In these days polygamy is very rare, chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
because the men outnumber the women, and because
Maori find it expedient to conform to Pakeha custom.
I visited a hapu once, whose chief had three wives;
but he was an earnest Christian&mdash;<i>à la Maori</i>. He
held prayers morning and evening in front of his
wharè, at which all the people of the kainga attended.
He conducted a long and lugubrious service every
Sunday, expounding the Scriptures and preaching
like a Spurgeon. He kept the Sabbath rigidly
sacred, and interlarded his conversation with texts.
Altogether he was a model man, never getting drunk
except when he visited the township, never cheating
anybody unless he was doing business with him.</p>

<p><i>Bonâ-fide</i> marriages between white men and
Maori women are seldomer contracted now than
they used to be. I knew a man whose Maori bride
brought him ten thousand acres of rich land as a
dowry. She was a delicious little brown innocent,
just such another as Mrs. Tangiao. Another man
I knew married a Maori girl out of gratitude, she
having saved his life from her own people in the
early warlike days. She had acted towards him in a
similar way to that in which Rahab of Jericho did to
the Hebrew spies.</p>

<p>Alliances of a less enduring kind than these are
matters of not infrequent occurrence. I have hinted
at the hospitable customs of the primitive kainga,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and the peculiar freedom, in certain respects, of unmarried
Maori girls. It is not necessary to say any
more on that head, I think. In justice to the race,
it is only fair to say, that no more faithful or virtuous
<i>wife</i> exists than a Maori one. Derelictions of conjugal
duty both were and are very rarely known,
in spite of somewhat arbitrary match-making. Such
are a heinous crime in Maori eyes.</p>

<p>There are certain drawbacks that are apt to mar
the conjugal felicity of the Pakeha who weds a
Maori. He is received as a member of the hapu
from which he has selected his bride, and is looked
upon by all Maori as being in a closer relationship
to them than other Pakeha. This adds other inconveniences
to those arising from your wife's predilection
for squatting on the drawing-room floor
and smoking her pipe; her careless <i>negligé</i> in
dress, except on state occasions; and her many
little delightful and eccentric propensities. For,
you have married not only your wife, but also all
her relations and kindred.</p>

<p>They will visit you, twenty or thirty at a time,
and stop a week or longer. They will slaughter
your pigs and sheep, dig up your potatoes and
kumera, and feed freely upon them. Your grocery
bill will attain to frightful proportions; and the
friendly mob will camp all over the house, just how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and where it pleases them. If you resent these
proceedings, your wife will cry and upbraid you, and
might even desert you altogether, while the hapu
would look upon it as the deadliest insult. As a <i>per
contra</i>, your wife's tribe will stand by you in all
difficulties and dangers. They will fight for you
with pleasure, will die for you and with you if
required; and a slight put upon you by anybody
whatsoever, is put upon the tribe in equal degree.</p>

<p>You may cajole these ladies and gentlemen into
helping you with any work that is going forward,
but the perquisites they will take to themselves will
be safe to ruin you. You may return their visits, as
much as you like, but that will not reimburse you
much. All that remains to you to do is to sell your
land, and to remove to some distant part of the
country, where there are no Maori. You must, in
such a case, carefully prepare some artful and
specious tale to satisfy your numerous relations-in-law,
and mitigate their grief at losing you. Lastly,
you must not take your wife out of New Zealand, for
she will pine, and possibly die, if you do.</p>

<p>Although the old Maori are commonly spoken of
as savages, they certainly did possess a degree of
civilization of their own. They had a traditional
history, a well-defined mythology, a code of laws
based on the tapu, a perfect tribal organization,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
industries and arts of no mean kind. Among them
were men, renowned long after their death in song
and story, as great statesmen, warriors, poets, artists,
and so on. Their dwellings are of simple construction,
but they are superior to Irish cabins by a long
way. Many of them were extravagantly decorated
with carvings and ornaments. The fortified pa were
planned with surprising engineering skill, and could
be defended against English troops. Even where
artillery was brought against the pa, the earthworks
made the siege no light work. Sometimes our
troops were actually repulsed from before these forts,
as at Ohaeawae and Okaehau.</p>

<p>The Maori cultivations were often extensive,
though, before the coming of Captain Cook, the
articles cultivated were not of great variety. Taro,
the farinaceous bulb of an arum; Kumera, the tuber
of a species of convolvulus; and Hue, the calabash or
gourd, were the crops; to which Cook and those who
came after him added potatoes, maize, wheat, oats
and barley, turnips, cabbages, peas, beans, fruit-trees,
and many other things, which were sedulously grown
and spread among their tribes by the Maori.</p>

<p>In many ways the Maori proved their patient
and careful industry. They made for themselves
tools of all kinds&mdash;axes, adzes, chisels, knives&mdash;out
of flint and jade, shells and shark's-teeth; and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
also contrived various formidable weapons. Many
of these articles are accurately curved and shaped,
polished and carved. With tools of this nature the
Maori levelled the gigantic kauri pine, and cut
from its trunk the ponderous waka-taua, or war-canoe;
cut and shaped with an accuracy that would
stand the test of nice geometrical instruments.</p>

<p>The war-canoes were fitted with richly carved
prows, stern-posts, and side-pieces, often inlaid with
shells and greenstone. They were sixty or seventy
feet in length; and would hold over a hundred men.
With forty or fifty paddles on a side, one of these
canoes could be driven through the water with all
the velocity of a steam-ram or racing skiff.</p>

<p>Not only canoes, but also the fronts of dwelling
and council-houses were adorned with elaborate
workmanship. Then there was a kind of wooden
statuary, which was set up in kainga and wahi-tapu;
and there were picture-writings cut upon rocks and
trees. Weapons, tools, personal ornaments, tiki&mdash;or
image-amulets&mdash;and so forth, showed very great
care and cleverness in design. The ornamentation
was very intricate, was finished off with surprising
nicety, and was executed in a style that cannot but
excite our wonder. For, it is to be recollected, that
the Maori possessed no metal tools or instruments.</p>

<p>Grotesque and curious as is Maori sculpture, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
yet clearly evidences some artistic leanings. There
was doubtless some sort of Society of Arts among
the tribes. For, certain men or women, peculiarly
skillful in some special particular, became persons of
great renown throughout the land, and their services
were sought after by favour, force, and fraud.</p>

<p>The highest branch of art, or, at least, what was
esteemed to be such, was the Maori heraldry, and
its emblazonment upon the living skin. Artists
skilled in this making of the moku&mdash;tattooers, as we
Pakeha call them&mdash;were tremendous dignitaries.
Their talents were a gift, were held to be genius,
and no means were hesitated at which could secure
one of these persons to a tribe. Battles were fought
for them, and poetical biographies of some of them
are even yet current. Such was the Art-cultus of
the Maori.</p>

<p>In pursuing the subject of ancient Maori civilization,
there are many points worthy of note. Dress is
one of these. Although the Maori were accustomed
to walk about completely naked&mdash;save and except
the moku on their face, chest, and thighs&mdash;yet they
had garments that were always donned on state
occasions, at night, and when the weather was cold.</p>

<p>Of course they had no idea of indecency, and,
indeed, have only a forced and artificial sense of it
now. Naked as they were in person, they were still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
more natural in mind, and this quality is still notably
apparent. It is not possible for a Maori to talk for
five minutes without uttering words, metaphors, and
allusions, that to us convey the most revolting and
shocking notions, though the speaker is entirely unconscious
of anything but the simplest matter of fact.
The language, as colloquially used, is full of stumbling
blocks to English refinement, and it is for this
reason, doubtless, that few settlers' wives and
daughters learn it at all, even though they may be
living in the midst of Maori.</p>

<p>The garments of the Maori consisted of a breech-clout
and a toga, made principally from phormium
fibre. I have called the chief universal garment a
<i>toga</i>, instead of giving it the ordinary designation of
"mat," or "blanket," because it was worn after the
manner of the old Roman toga; and, though a heavy,
bundling kind of dress, it gave a certain sort of
dignity to the wearer. These two articles were all
the garments proper, but several ornaments were
added to them. A kind of helmet was occasionally
worn; and sandals were used by persons with delicate
feet, when walking over rough ground.</p>

<p>The mats were made in considerable variety, of
dog-skins, and of flax-fibre. Some were very elaborate
and adorned with fringes, tassels, and embroidery,
being dyed of various colours. Some, made from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
choice species of phormium, were soft and silky. Into
the threads of others were woven feathers of the
kiwi and other birds. These two last kinds were
highly prized.</p>

<p>The whole process of making the simplest of
these dresses shows a degree of patient, industrial
enterprise, highly creditable to the operators. First
of all, the flax (<i>Phormium tenax</i>) was gathered, dried,
macerated, beaten, and the fibre picked out with the
fingers, combed, bleached, and otherwise prepared.
By these arduous and laborious processes it was
entirely freed from the gum which permeates the
leaf, and could be wound into thread of various
degrees of fineness. That accomplished, it was
woven into cloth, upon a frame of wooden pins stuck
into the ground. Fringes and embroidery were
manufactured with the simplest possible appliances,
and the juice of sundry trees, plants, and berries,
yielded good dyes of different hues.</p>

<p>The kaitaka, a toga with a silky gloss and texture,
was very highly esteemed; but a still rarer and most
valuable garment was the Weweru mo te huru kiwi,
or toga of kiwi's feathers. This was an ample robe
of woven flax, upon the outside of which were the
feathers. Now, as each feather of the kiwi is about
two or three inches long, and only a line or so in
breadth&mdash;more like a coarse hair than any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
feather, in fact&mdash;and as each feather was separately
worked into the texture of the flax, and as these
feathers were so plentifully disposed upon the mat
as to give it the appearance of thick fur, some idea
may be gained of the prodigious labour involved in
making such a toga, from first to last.</p>

<p>The commonest and coarsest mat took a woman
six months to make; the kaitaka took much longer;
while the feather robe occupied the exclusive time of
several women for a period of two or three years.
But then, it was a grand property, lasting not only
a lifetime, but capable of being handed down from
generation to generation. It was quite impervious
to rain or wind, and though somewhat bulky, was of
light weight. Besides these, a chief prized his robe
of long-haired white and yellow dogskins.</p>

<p>There was another kind of closely-woven dress,
te pukaha, which served as defensive armour against
javelins and lances, before the introduction of
muskets. There were various differences of make,
indicating a species of sumptuary law; but all the
dresses, of men and women, of chiefs and slaves,
had the same common characteristics.</p>

<p>The Maori neither are nor were at any time
pinched for food. An erroneous impression has
gone abroad that their cannibalism was the result of
a lack of anything else to eat. This is a totally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
wrong idea, as I had occasion to point out in a
former chapter, when speaking as to the causes
which are bringing about the extinction of the
race. The act of cannibalism was a part of the
system of warfare; it was the last outrage upon
an always detested foeman; the utmost indignity
that revenge could heap upon the enemy. Although,
in the earlier part of this century, no less than
fifteen hundred prisoners of war were killed and
eaten at a single feast by Hongi and his army, and
six hundred on another occasion, yet the last
authenticated act of cannibalism took place in 1843;
and, nowadays, Maori rather avoid allusion to the
subject. But it was only the prisoners of war who
were eaten, and that usually just after the battle,
before the heat and intoxication of the conquerors'
spirits had evaporated. They never ate human
flesh at other times, and prisoners whose lives were
spared became slaves&mdash;an easy kind of slavery it
was, too.</p>

<p>In the primitive times, should the crops of a
hapu fail them, or become too soon exhausted, there
was always fish in the rivers and fern-root in the
valleys, so that, however "hard up" a man might be,
he would not need to starve very long. Though
the moa was probably very scarce, if not entirely
extinct, towards the beginning of this century, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the bush abounded with birds that the Maori knew
well how to catch. Pigeons, nestors, parrots, rail,
kiwi, swamp-fowl, water-fowl, owls, parson-birds, all
these and more were eaten; while the native dogs
and rats were held to be great dainties. The former
were bred in numbers, and were fattened up for
food, and their skins were highly valued for togas
and mantles. An elaborate code of ceremonies,
songs, and customs are connected with rat-hunting,
showing that rats were so numerous as to be no
inconsiderable part of the food supply.</p>

<p>Then there were certain grubs and insects that
were held to be delicate morsels. The loathsome
larva of the weta, a large white grub, is speared on
a stick, toasted at the fire, and eaten with a silent
rapture that my pen could only feebly pourtray.</p>

<p>In the bays and tidal rivers are the mango or
sharks&mdash;the most highly-prized food-fish&mdash;the tamure
or schnapper, the whapuka or rock-cod, the kahawai
or mackerel, the porahi or herring, the kanae or
mullet, the patiki or sole, and many others. On
the shores are oysters, mussels, cockles, mutton-fish,
crabs, and other shell-fish in profuse abundance.
In the fresh-water creeks are eels (tuna), lampreys
(pipiharau), and whitebait (inanga).</p>

<p>Among indigenous vegetable productions came
first the universal fern-root (<i>Pteris esculenta</i>), which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
was cooked in various ways and made into a kind of
bread. Then there was the tap-root of the cabbage-tree
palm, yielding a highly farinaceous food when
baked; the pith or young shoot of the nikau; the
root of the toi; the root of the raupo, and the pollen
of the same plant made into bread; the berries of
hinau, similarly treated; the flower and fruit of
kiekie or tawhera; a species of seaweed boiled
with the juice of tupakihi berries, and forming a
nutritious jelly; some orchids, green spinach, cresses,
and fungi; the inner stems of mamaku or tree-fern;
the berries of poroporo, tawa-tawa, koraka, kahi katea,
rimu, and other trees.</p>

<p>The expressed juice of the tupakihi berry is
called by the Maori tutu. It is a pleasantly insipid
drink when fresh made, but appears to undergo a
slight fermentation when allowed to stand some
time, and when mixed with some other ingredient.
The seeds are always carefully eliminated from this
preparation, as they contain a dangerous narcotic
principle. The old Maori say, that in ancient
times, before going into battle, they used to eat taro
to make them strong and enduring, shark-meat to
make them ferocious, and used to drink tutu to make
them brave and unflinching.</p>

<p>The Maori cooking operations were, in former
times, always performed by women and slaves;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
now, though women are invariably the cooks in
the kainga, yet no man considers it beneath him
to prepare his own food when obliged to do so.
Most of the old methods of cooking have fallen very
much into disuse, since the modern Maori possess
kettles, iron camp-ovens, billies, and other Pakeha
appliances; but still, in remote spots, one may come
across a relic of the olden time.</p>

<p>The only method of boiling formerly employed
was by dropping heated stones into the water contained
in a calabash or rind of the hue. Expert as
they were in this process, it was still a rather toilsome
and ineffective one, and in these days of
kettles and pans it is never returned to. Fish and
meat were frequently roasted on the clear side of
the fire in the ordinary hunters' fashion, but the
great national culinary institution was the earth-oven,
the kopa or hangi.</p>

<p>A pit was dug in the ground, one foot or more
in depth, and suited in size to the quantity of provisions
to be cooked. In this hole a fire was built,
completely filling it, and in the fire a number of
pebble stones were heated. When the fire had
reached a proper heat it was entirely raked out of
the pit. A layer of the red-hot stones was laid along
the bottom, by means of improvised tongs of green
wood, and these were carefully and quickly covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
with certain green leaves. Then the pork or fish or
potatoes, previously washed, cleaned, and wrapped
up in green flax, were put into the hangi; a quantity
of the red-hot stones were put over and round it;
water was poured over the whole; green flax mats
were hastily heaped on top and tucked in at the
sides; and, lastly, the pit was filled in with earth
well stamped and beaten down.</p>

<p>In the course of an hour or more, according to
the size of the joint, the hangi was opened, the
provisions lifted out, the wrappings unfolded, and
their contents placed in baskets of green flax, and
thus dinner was served. The steam, generated
under pressure in the ovens, was forced into every
fibre of the articles cooking, so that these were most
thoroughly done. Whole pigs&mdash;and whole human
bodies in the cannibal times&mdash;are cooked in these
hangi to perfection. I have eaten meat and vegetables
done in them, that could not have been better
cooked by a <i>chef de cuisine</i> decorated with the red
ribbon of <i>la Légion d'honneur</i>.</p>

<p>It was one of the old customs never to eat in the
living-houses. Cooking was always performed in
the open air, and usually is so still. A rude shelter
protected the fire in rainy weather; and at such
times the meal was eaten under the verandah of
the wharè.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Burial customs among the old Maori were peculiar
and complicated, and differed much among various
hapu. In the case of slaves and inferiors, the bodies
were thrown aside in some place where they could
not be offensive to the living, or they were hastily
interred on the beach, or somewhere in the forest.</p>

<p>The death of a chief, or rangatira of note, was
an affair of great importance. It was announced
by loud wailing and crying&mdash;the Maori idea of grief
being a noisy and demonstrative one. The corpse
was washed and painted, dressed in the finest
garments and ornaments possessed by the defunct,
and laid in state in the verandah of the wharè, with
a great display of weapons and trophies of various
kinds around it. All the near relations of the
deceased assembled to cry over him, and many&mdash;particularly
of the ladies of his family&mdash;gashed their
faces, breasts, and arms, with shells and obsidian
knives. It was thought to be the most decorous
and decent show of mourning to have the face and
breast completely covered with the dried and clotted
blood resulting from the numerous self-inflicted
gashes.</p>

<p>After a day or two of these ceremonies, the body
was taken by the tohunga and his assistants within
the sacred grove, or wahi tapu. There, still wrapped
in his most cherished robes, with all his ornaments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
weapons, and ensigns of dignity around him, with
baskets of food to support him on his journey to the
other world&mdash;and, in olden times, with a strangled
wife and slave or two&mdash;the corpse was left, either
placed in the fork of a tree, on an ornamental
platform or stage, or buried in the ground.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, during the progress of these ceremonies,
many karakia, or prayers, were uttered; and
the multitude of friends, relations, and followers
assembled outside the wahi tapu made the air
resound with their frantic shouts and yells, with the
firing of guns, and every possible kind of noise.
When the body had been thus deposited and left,
a great feast took place, something after the manner
of an Irish wake.</p>

<p>In the course of a couple of years or so after,
when the tohunga deemed that decomposition was
complete, a second series of ceremonies took place.
This was called the hahunga, or scraping of the
bones. Amid renewed wailing and weeping from
the assembled friends, the bones of the dead were
collected by the tohunga. They were scraped clean
with a good deal of ceremony and karakia, were
painted, garnished with feathers, wrapped up in rich
mats, and abundantly wept over. Finally, they
were deposited high up in some sacred tree, or in
a fissure of the rock, or upon an elevated stage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
profusely ornamented, and then they were done
with.</p>

<p>Many burying-places still exist, filled with these
weird mementoes of the past. Of course no Maori,
however Christianized or civilized he may be, will
knowingly trespass within their limits; but Pakeha
do so frequently. Collectors of "curios" have
found in these places a rich field for treasure-seeking;
but, even at the present day, and among
the most law-abiding tribes, it is by no means safe
to go curio-hunting in the old and apparently forgotten
wahi tapu. The Maori are intensely averse
from allowing any stranger to penetrate these places,
and if they caught any one despoiling their dead, it
would rouse a flame among them not easily to be
appeased. Certain lands upon which are situated
such sacred spots are not to be bought for love or
money from their Maori owners. Still, as the rising
generation steps into the shoes of its fathers, prejudices
of this kind give way before the influence of
Pakeha gold.</p>

<p>Some land, in a settled district that I know well,
was much sought after a year or two ago by persons
settling in the neighbourhood, it being of particularly
choice quality; but the central part of this block
being a burial-place, the old chief, who was the
principal owner, refused large offers, and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
not part with an acre of the sacred soil for any
inducement that could be held out to him. Lately,
however, he died, and his young heirs were persuaded&mdash;not
without much difficulty, though&mdash;to sell
the block to an English settler.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the burial of a man of rank is conducted
upon different principles. I witnessed the
interment of a lady of high rank among the Ngapuhi,
at Waimate, which may serve to illustrate modern
customs in this respect. The deceased, though
externally differing but little from the usual dirty,
repulsive-looking, and hag-like appearance of old
Maori women, was yet a personage of great note
and consequence. She was the last lineal descendant
of a great chief, and possessed all the authority of a
queen or princess-absolute herself. Consequently,
when she died, the hapu&mdash;or section of the tribe&mdash;of
which she was the undisputed head resolved to
celebrate the occasion with the most gorgeous
obsequies it was in their power to get up.</p>

<p>The body was laid in state and wailed over, but
there was not much cutting of faces done, only a
sort of compromise between the old custom and the
usages of a more enlightened age&mdash;a scratch or two
here and there, made by the most conservative
among the mourners. A coffin was made, or procured,
and a rich pall of black velvet and white silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
covered it. The procession then set out for Waimate,
distant some eight or ten miles from the deceased's
kainga.</p>

<p>The coffin was borne on a litter between two
horses, and the procession was formed by several
hundred mounted Maori, of both sexes and all ages,
all dressed in their best attire, some with crape
scarves, but mostly without. They proceeded in a
long straggling line, the coffin being borne along in
front, and in that manner wound over the ranges
and through the bush towards the settlement and
mission-church of Waimate.</p>

<p>At times there was much cheerful laughter and
talking in the procession, and parties would suddenly
dash out of the ranks for a furious gallop. Then
there would be a mournful wave pass over the
cavalcade, and long-drawn wails and cries of sorrow
would break forth from all. This again would
alternate with sudden gaiety; and so, in such
manner, the churchyard was reached. The horses
were tethered all round the churchyard fence, and
their riders, augmented by a crowd of others who
had assembled on foot, and by the whole population
of the settlement, entered the church.</p>

<p>The service was conducted in the ordinary
manner of the Church of England. But when the
coffin was lowered into the grave, the Maori who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
crowded round it appeared heart-broken with grief.
Tears streamed down every face, eyes were turned
up to heaven, while sobs and moans and clamorous
wailing broke out on all sides.</p>

<p>A few minutes after the service was completed
the sorrowing crowd dispersed, all hastening in the
direction of the village where the funeral feast was
to be held. Many of the cavaliers started off with
loud whoops, upon an exciting race at the utmost
speed of their horses, while all banished, for the
time being, every semblance of grief.</p>

<p>I went to the kainga in the evening, as unobtrusively
as possible, to see how the feasting was
conducted. Men and women sat, stood, lay, or
lounged about, clustering round the fires and ovens
every now and then to do some feeding, or laughing,
chatting, smoking, and generally enjoying themselves.
But, every now and then, some one would
set up a loudly-chanted lament, and instantly all
would crouch upon the ground in a sitting posture,
and, while the tears fell in abundance from their
eyes, would wail and rock themselves about in the
most terrible anguish of grief, apparently. In a
minute or two this would subside, and all would
return at once, and without an effort, to their former
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>O'Gaygun, who had accompanied me, said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
if there had only been a fiddler present, to play <i>The
Coina</i> or <i>Savournah Deelish</i>, the resemblance to a
wake in "ould Oireland" would have been complete;
for "lashins of whiskey was goin', annyhow!"</p>

<p>In this manner several days and nights were
spent. I am afraid to say how many sheep and
pigs were killed, how many tons of potato and
kumera, and sacks of flour, were devoured; but the
total, I know, was something prodigious. The
stores at Ohaeawae and Waitangi did a roaring
trade in supplying tea, sugar, tobacco, liquor, and
the other requirements of the feasters.</p>

<p>There was a very singular custom prevalent
among the Maori called the moru. If a misfortune
of any kind happened to a man, all his neighbours,
headed by his nearest and dearest friends, instantly
came down upon him and pillaged him of everything
he possessed.</p>

<p>In 1827, Mr. Earle, who resided some time in
New Zealand, and afterwards published a narrative
of his experiences, relates that the houses or huts
belonging to himself and his companions on Kororareka
Beach accidentally caught fire. The fire
took place at a rather critical moment, just when a
number of Maori had arrived to do battle with the
Kororareka natives, who were Earle's allies. Directly
the fire broke out, both parties suspended prepara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>tions
for hostilities and rushed upon the devoted
little settlement, which they pillaged of everything
that could be carried off. Earle and his party could
do nothing to prevent them, and they were thus
stripped of the greater part of their possessions,
according to the custom of the moru.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of the Maori race is the singular
power that imagination has over them. It seems,
indeed, to take practical effect, and the suddenness
with which the will can operate is not less startling
than the action so induced.</p>

<p>A Maori can throw himself into a transport of
rage, grief, joy, or fear, at a moment's notice. This
is not acting either, it is grim reality, as many an
instance proves. For example, there is Hau-hau.
The principal manifestation in that singular new
religion is the ecstasy and excitement into which
whole congregations appear to throw themselves.
There is something akin to the mesmeric phenomena
in the extraordinary gusts of feeling that sweep over
a Hau-hau conventicle. The leader works himself
up first, and then the rest follow. They shout, they
scream, they roll on the ground, they weep, they
groan, and, while in this state, appear insensible to
every external influence but the strange excitement
that possesses them.</p>

<p>Any Maori can die when he likes. He wills it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
and the fact is accomplished. He says, perhaps,
"I am going to die on Wednesday next!" and when
the day comes, he really goes into the bush, lays
down and expires.</p>

<p>Then they can weep at will. A tangi (weeping)
can be performed by any Maori at a moment's
notice. Though they are a cheerful and laughter-loving
people, they make the tangi a frequent
ceremony. A Maori will be laughing and talking
in the greatest glee and high spirits, when he is
suddenly accosted by a friend of his whom he may
not have seen for some time. Instantly the two
will crouch upon the ground with faces close together,
and, rocking their bodies from side to side,
wailing and sobbing, the tears will drop from their
eyes and roll down their cheeks more abundantly
than most Britons would think possible; like a
shower of summer rain, in fact.</p>

<p>This is the ordinary mode of recognition of
friends, founded, no doubt, upon the insecurity of
life that formerly prevailed. Partings are effected
in the same way; and on all occasions where grief
is really felt, or where it is considered necessary or
in accordance with etiquette to put on the semblance
of grief, a tangi takes place.</p>

<p>Modern usage, however, following even more
closely in the European style with every succeeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
generation, has rather spoilt this among other
customs. That is to say, most young Maori of
the period do not tangi unless they are really
affected with the emotion of grief, although they do
not seem to have lost the power of weeping at will.</p>

<p>One of our neighbours, who had formed a close
intimacy with the Maori of the district, went home
on a visit to England. We heard that he intended
to return in the ill-fated ship <i>Cospatrick</i>, and when
the news arrived of the terrible disaster which overtook
that vessel, we mourned our friend as among
the lost.</p>

<p>A party of his Maori friends arrived at his farm,
and held there a sort of combined tangi and prayer-meeting.
When he finally turned up, having luckily
come out in another ship, the Maori assembled from
all sides, and so warmly did they congratulate him
on his safety, that they were obliged to hold another
tangi to give proper effect to their feelings.
Though there may seem to be something childlike
and pleasing about this custom theoretically, I cannot
say that it is particularly agreeable in practice
or to participate in.</p>

<p>The old Maori method of salutation was to press
the noses together. Like many more old customs,
it is now nearly quite forgotten; the Pakeha handshaking
and the Pakeha kissing having altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
superseded it. Only once was I subjected to the
nose-pressing process, which was done to me by
a very old rangatira,&mdash;our very good friend the
Rev. Tama-te-Whiti, in fact&mdash;who took that means
of showing a more than ordinary esteem for me on
a certain occasion elsewhere spoken of.</p>

<p>In these days the Maori no longer manufacture
any of their old tools, weapons, ornaments, clothes,
etc. They now buy Pakeha goods at the stores,
and prefer them to their old appliances; in fact,
the latter are becoming very scarce, since the bulk
of them are eagerly bought up by collectors as
"curios." Very few of the waka-taua, or war-canoes,
are now in native possession, though, until recently,
there used to be a race of them at the Auckland
regatta on Anniversary Day (January 29).</p>

<p>The various sorts of ordinary canoes are still
plentiful enough, though they are probably destined
to disappear before very long. The Maori do not
make them now, they build or purchase boats made
after the Pakeha fashion. The old canoe is an
ungainly and uncomfortable vessel, hollowed out of
the trunk of a single tree. It rides flat on the
water, and is very seaworthy, being with difficulty
upset, and going as well when full of water as when
dry. The canoes are driven by slender spear-shaped
paddles, that are dug into the water, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
were; with them a great speed can be attained,
nevertheless. The ordinary canoes will carry from
a dozen to a score of persons; but some are larger,
like the war-canoes, and would hold a hundred or
more, pretty tightly packed, though.</p>

<p>The race at the Auckland regatta used to
be an exciting sight. The canoes, with their high,
carved prows and stern-posts, were richly decorated
with all sorts of barbaric ornaments. (It was only
the waka-taua that were so furnished, ordinary
canoes not having prows, stern-posts, or bulwarks
attached to them.) They were crammed with
rowers, chosen from among the strongest men of the
contesting hapu. At the stern, upon a sort of deck,
stood the chief, costumed in his bravest robes and
ornaments, and carrying a patu, truncheon, or long
wand in his hand.</p>

<p>The race would start with boat-chaunts among
the paddlers, gradually enlivened by jibing shouts
at the rival canoes. Then, as the race grew hotter,
the foam would begin to fly as the paddles dashed
up the water; the chiefs would stamp and rage on
their platforms, shouting encouragement to their
own men and yelling defiance to the others. When
the termination of the race drew near, the yells and
screams would be deafening, the energy of the
paddlers exerted to the utmost, the gesticulations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
and cries of the chiefs only to be compared to those
of frenzied madmen, and the excitement and fury
of all concerned would seem only to be ended in
bloodshed.</p>

<p>But all this excitement would quiet down after
the goal was won, and no fighting or ill-feeling was
the consequence. Nowadays, at the various regattas
held on the rivers at different times, craft of all
kinds, owned and manned by Maori, will amicably
contest with those of settlers; and, whether in the
whaleboat or the skiff, the Maori are formidable
opponents to the Pakeha, who by no means invariably
snatch the prize.</p>

<p>In common with the disappearance of the canoe
is that of many other articles of native manufacture.
Their old tools and weapons are rarities even among
themselves, having long ago been bartered away for
the more useful instruments of the Pakeha; and the
art of making them has been forgotten. Even the
almost sacred merè ponamu is a thing of the past.
It was a large axe formed of "greenstone," or transparent
green jade, often exquisitely shaped and
polished. It was sometimes mounted on an elaborate
handle, much carved and ornamented; or, in
most cases, it was shaped in the short club-like form
of the favourite weapon, all in one piece, and adapted
for one hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>The merè ponamu was the special weapon of
the ariki, and was emblematic of his dignity. A
good deal of sanctity attached to it, and it was held
to be a tribal treasure. When defeated or threatened
with its loss, the ariki or tohunga would hide the
merè; and often the hiding-place would be unknown,
since the chief might be killed before he could
reveal it to his successor. In such a case the most
careful and painstaking search would be afterwards
entered upon by the tribe, who would even continue
it for years, until the treasure was discovered.</p>

<p>It will be remembered how Tuwharè hid the
tiki of the Ngatewhatua, after the capture of Marahemo
by Hongi. A tiki is a grotesque image,
carved out of the same stone&mdash;ponamu&mdash;as the
merè. Much the same degree of sanctity attached
to either. Merè made of wood, bone, or other
kinds of stone had, of course, no especial value.
When a new ariki was called to lead the tribe, he
was invested with the merè ponamu with much
important ceremony, just as Turkish sultans are
girded with the sword of Othman, in token of their
assumption of supreme power.</p>

<p>Not many years ago, it chanced that a gum-digger
accidentally found a merè ponamu in the
bush. The first person he happened to meet was
a Maori, to whom he showed his "find." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Maori examined it carefully, and questioned the
digger as to the precise locality in which he had
found it. He then asked the digger to sell it to
him, which, after some demur, the latter eventually
consented to do, the price he put on the "curio"
being three notes (£3). The Maori went off to
fetch the money; and by-and-by returned to the
digger's camp with one or two of his compatriots.
The sale was then concluded, and after the Pakeha
had expressed himself as satisfied with the bargain,
he was somewhat chagrined at being told that the
merè was the long-lost weapon of a great chief,
which had been unsuccessfully searched for during
long years, and that, had he demanded three hundred
pounds instead of only three, the tribe would have
found means to raise it, so much did they prize
the relic.</p>

<p>It speaks highly for the sense of justice and
peaceableness of the modern Maori that no thought
of forcibly taking possession of the merè seems to
have occurred to these men, although the digger
was alone, and they were numerous. How different
might the climax have been had they been Irish
peasants instead of semi-civilized Maori!</p>

<p>The Maori have no sense of honour, but they
have a keen love of justice, which suffices to take
its place. Manifestations of their principles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
equity are often very amusing to us; but they might
sometimes serve to improve the decisions of our
law-courts, despite their crudity. They are generally
based on the idea of utu, or compensation, and
are deliciously simple. Thus, adultery is now
punished among the Maori themselves in the following
fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p>The chiefs hold a korero, or palaver, over the
offenders, and settle the amount of utu to be paid.
The man has to pay a fine to the husband, father,
or nearest relative of the woman; she, in like
manner, is sentenced to pay a similar sum to the
wife, mother, or nearest relative of the man. If a
culprit has no property, he or she has to go to work
among the Pakeha, or dig gum, or raise it in some
such fashion. There never seems to be any attempt
to evade a fine of this kind; it is always faithfully
paid to the last penny.</p>

<p>A Maori stole a bag of sugar from a store. He
was pulled up before the local magistrate, and sent
for a month's imprisonment. When the term expired
and he returned to the tribe, the chiefs held a
korero over him as usual. To their ideas of equity,
the imprisonment counted for nothing, it was simply
one of the stupid Pakeha customs, and had merely
delayed the course of real (Maori) justice. Accordingly,
the thief was sentenced to pay the value of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the stolen sugar to the proprietor of the store.
Next, he had to pay utu to the same person; and,
finally, he had to pay utu to the chiefs as representing
the tribe, to compensate them for the loss of
credit the community had sustained through his
offence.</p>

<p>The following incident occurred in a district not
otherwise alluded to in these sketches, and the
locality of which is purposely concealed. Should it
meet the eye of any person concerned, I beg he
will hold me excused for recording it. It could
only be identified by himself. I insert it simply
because it is the best instance within my knowledge
of Maori justice, and of modern Maori manners in
this particular.</p>

<p>There were two brothers who had settled in a
remote district. The elder of the two had occasion
to go over to Sydney on business for some months,
and left the younger to manage the farm in his
absence. The young fellow had only a hired lad
to bear him company, besides occasional visits from
some of his chums among the neighbouring settlers.
By-and-by the lad left him, and he hired a couple
of Maori girls to do some of the necessary work.</p>

<p>I have described what Maori girls are like, and
so, here, close intercourse very soon had its natural
result, and human nature triumphed over Pakeha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
morality. The girls went back to their kainga after
a time, and, after the wont of their race, made no
secret of anything that had occurred.</p>

<p>Now the ariki of the little hapu had "got
religion," as I have heard it phrased, and tried his
best to be sanctimonious and pharisaic. He chose
to affect violent rage on hearing of the young farmer's
breach of Pakeha moral law, and sent off a demand
for a large sum of money as utu, in default of payment
of which he promised to come up and burn the
farmer's house and drive off his stock.</p>

<p>The settler resented and repudiated this claim
for utu altogether, and, hearing that the Maori were
getting their guns ready for the raid, he summoned
all his neighbours to assist in his defence. A dozen
or more of them armed and came over to stop with
him, and a very pretty little disturbance seemed
imminent.</p>

<p>However, there was a clergyman who had great
influence with the hapu. At first, he probably
helped to kindle the chief's ire by inveighing
against the hideous guilt of the farmer, after the
manner of unworldly clerics; but, seeing subsequently
the direction things were about to take, he
altered his tactics. Knowing the Maori character
thoroughly, he took what was certainly the best
possible step under the circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of preaching against war and bloodshed,
he stopped the war-party, as it was setting off, by
intimating that the house, land, and bulk of the stock
belonged to the absent brother, and that it would,
therefore, be wrong to touch it. Maori justice
instantly perceived the point, and a korero was
immediately held to discuss it. Then the chief and
his advisers began to find themselves in a hopeless
muddle. They could not withdraw the claim for utu
honourably&mdash;according to their notions&mdash;and in
default of it they must exact something. At the
same time, it was repugnant to their ideas of justice
to meddle with what belonged to an unoffending
man, and he an absentee to boot. So the korero
lasted day after day, and the Maori could find no
way out of their dilemma.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the father of the girl who had caused
the mischief, and who was a greedy old wretch,
happily cut the Gordian knot. While things were
still unsettled, he sneaked off one day alone, and
made his way to the farm. There he intimated to
the young settler that he was prepared to take five
notes for his daughter's wrong, and would consider
all claims liquidated by it. The young man's blood
was up, however, and he refused to pay the fraction
of a penny as utu. But some of his friends were
cooler; and after a long palaver the young fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
consented to purchase a horse from the Maori, at a
price somewhat above its value.</p>

<p>Back went the outraged father to the hapu and
told what he had done. The ariki scolded him
heartily for his baseness, that is to say, for the
small amount of utu he had exacted. But all were
overjoyed at the incident, which served to make
a way out of the difficulty. An ambassador was
sent up to the farm with the following message
from the ariki, which I roughly translate&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, friend! There is now peace, and things
are smooth between us. Pita is a fool, he took what
was too little. That is his affair, and I have told
him my mind. You have made utu to him and the
wretch is satisfied. That ends all. I have no more
to say. We are friends as before."</p>

<p>And now arose a new phase of Maori character.
They are always very desirous to get up alliances
between the races, and will do anything to induce a
Pakeha to marry a Maori girl. Even such informal
engagements as that just hinted at are so far from
being repugnant to them, that they generally show
an increased regard for the Pakeha who is indiscreetly
amorous among their <i>unmarried</i> women.</p>

<p>The chief in this case was governed, in the first
instance, by an artificial veneer of sentiment inculcated
by the new religion. Now that this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
broken through, and the vexed question of utu disposed
of, the genuine Maori feeling rose to the
surface, and a warm friendliness arose for the Pakeha&mdash;the
<i>rangatira</i> Pakeha be it remembered&mdash;who had
shown that he "liked the Maori girls."</p>

<p>Accompanied by a score or so of the rangatira of
his hapu, the ariki rode over to the young settler's
place. As proof of the re-establishment of cordial
relations, kitsful of peaches, melons, kumera, taro,
and other gifts were carried by the party. The
young man met them with all hospitality, killed a
pig and feasted the party for a couple of days, presented
a dog to the ariki, and finally paid a return
visit to the kainga, where he was received with
open arms by the entire hapu. He has ever since
remained a prime favourite with the Maori, who,
singularly enough, respected him for his line of action
when the difficulty arose, almost as much as they
warmed to him for his amorous predilection.</p>

<p>Little misunderstandings of this sort now and
then arise between Pakeha and Maori, but they are
generally smoothed down in some such fashion as
the above. The worst difficulties are those where
Maori of different tribes come into collision with one
another, when the ancient feuds and hatreds spring
up and cause much trouble. Especially is this the
case when Christian sectarianism is an added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
element of bitterness and strife. I remember an
instance of this that occurred in the north in 1875
or 1876.</p>

<p>There was a Land Court held in what was then
quite a new district, and at it the chiefs of a Ngapuhi
hapu laid claim to a certain block, which they had
agreed to sell to a settler. But a Ngatewhatua, who
was present by the merest chance, disputed the claim
on the ground that the block formed a part of his
tribal territory. The Ngapuhi ridiculed him, and
replied that their tribe under Hongi had, in former
times, conquered the Ngatewhatua and annexed
their territory, leaving only a corner for the remnant
of the conquered to live on. This was according to
ancient Maori law.</p>

<p>But the Ngatewhatua declared that, also in
accordance with Maori usage, the conquerors having
never taken possession of the district nor resided on
any part of the block, it reverted to its original
owners, the Ngatewhatua. Both sides had thus a
fair show of right, and neither having occupied the
land within the memory of man, it was difficult to
decide which had the best claim.</p>

<p>The commissioner left the Maori to come to
some agreement among themselves, for he could not
adjust their differences, while he was bound to find
a native owner for the block before the Crown grant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
could be made out. Both sides now withdrew in
great dudgeon, while the few Pakeha in the neighbourhood
began to feel somewhat nervous and
anxious as to what was to follow.</p>

<p>The Ngatewhatua returned to his hapu and
related all that had occurred. A korero was immediately
held and rapidly concluded. It was agreed
at once that decisive action was necessary; so the
ariki ordered his men to take their guns and other
arms, to launch their boats, and proceed with him to
the township where the Land Court was being held.
All the available men of the hapu, some forty or fifty
in number, were ready at the chief's command, and
at once set off; while messages were sent to warn
other communities of the Ngatewhatua, and to invite
them to take part in the coming fray.</p>

<p>In due time, the ariki of the Ngatewhatua and
his band arrived at the scene of action. They
rowed up the river to the township where the Land
Court was being held, and which was near the disputed
block, with all the pomp and circumstance of
Maori war, so far as it was possible in their modern
civilized condition.</p>

<p>Near the little township, awaiting their arrival,
was a still more numerous body of armed Ngapuhi,
who greeted them with yells of defiance. The few
officials and Pakeha at the place did their best to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
allay the excitement of the natives, but without success.
They were not listened to, or were told to leave
things alone. This was a purely Maori question,
with which Pakeha had nothing to do; <i>they</i> were not
in any way threatened; let them keep out of it, then.</p>

<p>But the settlers knew that this faction fight, if it
once took place and resulted in bloodshed, might
lead to a general conflagration among the northern
tribes. They were at their wit's end to know what
to do. It was no use sending to Auckland, for there
were very few of the armed constabulary there; and,
had there been more, they could not have got up
to the scene of action within a week's time. The
next best thing that could be done had been done&mdash;messengers
had been sent off post haste to summon
a certain Wesleyan missionary, who of all men had
the greatest influence with the Ngatewhatua, and
would be patiently heard by the Ngapuhi, although
the hapu concerned were professedly converts to
Roman Catholicism.</p>

<p>This gentleman resided near the principal Ngatewhatua
kainga, and was unluckily absent from home
when the news came from the Land Court. Had
he been there, the ariki would have probably consulted
him, and the war party would consequently
not have started. But he was absent on a visit to a
distant river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>The reverend gentleman was not very popular
among the scattered settlers in the district, and had
often made himself obnoxious to them, as they considered.
He had lived among the Maori many
years; and, being a somewhat narrow-minded man,
seemed to look upon the settlers as disturbers of
that Christian peace which he believed had covered
the tribe among whom he ministered. However,
when the emergency arose and he received notice of
the impending conflict between the rival tribes, he
proved himself equal to the occasion. Taking boat
to a suitable point, he there borrowed a horse from a
farmer; and, riding at full speed for some thirty miles
across the ranges and through the bush, arrived at
the township just in the nick of time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rival Maori had been occupied
in the usual preliminaries to a fight. The Ngatewhatua
had disembarked; and on the following day
the two parties were drawn up, facing one another, at
a short distance apart. The korero then commenced,
and was kept up hour after hour by alternate orators
on either side. These delivered themselves in the
verbose and florid style customary, running up and
down between the lines, and using very unparliamentary
language, I have no doubt. The men of
the two factions were seated on the ground meanwhile,
occasionally grimacing or defying each other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
The modern veneer of civilization and Christianity
seemed entirely to have disappeared, and the ancient
Maori manners to have superseded it. At length,
such a pitch of rage was reached that the war-dance
appeared inevitable, and after that nothing would
stop the conflict. It was just at this juncture that
the missionary rode up. Dismounting, he at once
strode between the rival lines, being greeted with
growls and opprobrious epithets by the Ngapuhi, and
with cries of "Go home! Go home!" from his
own flock.</p>

<p>I think I can see that scene now. In the foreground
the broad surface of the river, flowing
between low banks covered with light scrub. To
the right the few houses of the little settlement, with
a group of pale-faced Pakeha, men, women, and
children, anxiously awaiting the upshot of the
"muss." In front, a stretch of open land, partly
grassed and partly covered with fern, with stumps
and logs here and there visible. Behind it clumps
of scrub, and, close to, the line of the heavy bush,
extending all round and covering the hill-ranges that
rise further back.</p>

<p>In the centre of this scene are the two bands of
Maori; brown tatterdemalions in ragged shirts and
trousers, armed with guns, and merè, and patu, and
axes, some squatting on the ground, some standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
erect, all convulsed with anger and ungovernably
excited. Before each rank is the ariki, and one or
two principal men on either side.</p>

<p>Between the two armies strides the tall, gaunt
form of the missionary, his arms raised and gesticulating,
his grey hair and beard floating on the wind.
Heedless of his reception he begins to talk. He is
a perfect master of Maori oratory, with its long
quotations from old tradition and from the Bible,
its short pithy sentences, its queer interjectional
effects. Gradually the tumult quiets down, the
Maori begin to listen, the Ngapuhi forget they are
Catholics.</p>

<p>For two mortal hours he talks to them, preaches
at them. What arguments he uses I cannot say;
they are effective ones evidently, for there is a
perfect hush among the combatants at last, and all
eyes are turned attentively upon the speaker.
Finally, he proposes an equal sharing of the sum
to be obtained for the disputed land. There is
hesitation&mdash;he enforces the point, drives it home to
the minds of his hearers. Then comes an "Ai!"
from the Ngatewhatua ariki, followed by a reluctant
"Kuia!" from the Ngapuhi chief. A chorus of
"Ai! Ai! Kuia! Kuia!" "Yes! agreed!" resounds
on all sides; the dispute is at an end.</p>

<p>But all is not over, the happy moment must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
seized by the minister of the gospel. Standing on
a little knoll between the lately hostile taua, he
slowly uncovers, raises one hand upwards, looks to
heaven, solemnly enunciates the Lord's Prayer.
The effect is marvellous, the Maori go down on
their knees around him and fervently chorus the
words as he utters them, while tears stream from
many eyes, and groans of contrition break from
many breasts. The prayer finished, the missionary
looks about him on the rival warriors, who now crouch
like chidden children before him. He commands
them, in the Name they have just invoked, to lay
aside their weapons, and to be friends. With unquestioning
faith and simple alacrity they obey his
summons, and Ngapuhi and Ngatewhatua rush into
each other's arms.</p>

<p>That night a grand feast is held to cement the
new-made friendship; and next day the two chiefs
go arm-in-arm to the Land Court, there to conclude
the sale of the disputed land, while the bulk of their
followers, with much friendly leave-taking, depart
on their several ways.</p>

<p>So eventuated the worst difficulty of the kind
that has arisen in the North for many years. The
affair made no stir beyond the district, for "our
special correspondent" was not present, while settlers
and officials had very good reasons for not giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
publicity to the matter. In view of emigration, and
all the rest of it, government, and colonists too, have
a disposition to hush up any little perplexities of
such a sort; so only a short and garbled account
of this narrow escape from a battle reached the
Auckland papers, which may be found in them by
those who like to look for it.</p>

<p>I think this anecdote may serve to conclude my
sketches of Maori manners. It shows the childlike
temper of the Maori, their easily excited passions,
quick gusts of rage, and equally ready return to
docility and good-humour. It is an instance of how
modern Maori character is driven by two widely
different forces, and of how it oscillates between two
systems&mdash;the tapu Maori and the tapu Pakeha. It
illustrates with strange force&mdash;more so than any
other incident which has happened in this generation,
perhaps&mdash;that wonderful power, once so extensive
and real, but now almost obsolete except in such
rare instances as this&mdash;that influence which I have
previously spoken of, and have named "the Mana
of the Missionary."</p>

<small>OUR NATURALIST'S NOTE-BOOK.</small></h2>


<p>"It is impossible to imagine, in the wildest and
most picturesque walks of Nature, a sight more
sublime and majestic, or which can more forcibly
challenge the admiration of the traveller, than a
New Zealand forest,"&mdash;writes an early voyager to
this country. From the first, those who visited
these shores were struck with the extent and beauty
of our forests, the size of the trees, and the wealth
of the vegetation. And, at the present day, the
emigrant from Scotland or England, brought here
into the depths of the bush, fails not to feel his
inmost nature responding to the glory and the
grandeur of the scenery.</p>

<p>The woodlands of Northern New Zealand may
be divided into two general classes, the heavy bush
and the light bush. The first is the true primeval
forest, the growth, probably, of two or three thousand
years. This is by far the most abundant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
extensive of the two. There is nothing in Great
Britain to afford comparison with it.</p>

<p>The light bush, on the other hand, is not dissimilar
to a very wild and luxuriant English wood,
if one excepts the difference of the vegetation. It
fills up the gullies, and covers the hill-sides, where
Maori cultivation once occupied the ground. It is
by no means so extensive as the heavy bush, but
may be said to fringe it here and there, and to
border once populous rivers. These copsewoods
spring up very rapidly. Light bush that is only
forty years old will rival English woods that have
stood a century, in the relative size of the trees.
The jungle is so dense that it is often almost impervious
to passage altogether, until the axe has
cleared a road. It has a rich and fresh appearance
when looked at as a whole, a verdancy and wealth of
varying tints, a general beauty that seems to make
our name for it appear an ill-chosen one; for we
generally call the light bush "scrub."</p>

<p>The heavy bush, in these northern districts, is
divisible into two kinds. There is the kauri bush
and the mixed bush. The first, as its name implies,
is forest where the kauri grows alone, or, at least,
preponderates. It has already been described. It
is something solemn and tremendous in the last
degree, grand and gloomy, and even awful. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
are but few trees produced anywhere in the world
that can rival the mammoth kauri in bulk. When
we consider the closeness with which the trees
stand, the uniform mightiness of their endless ranks,
stretching on over hill and dale for many a mile,
it is not easy to say where we may look to find
anything to match or compare with kauri bush.</p>

<p>The mixed bush is very different. Here one is
in an actual land of enchantment. Uniformity is
gone; unending variety is in place of it. The eye
is almost wearied with delight, wonder, and admiration
at all around, for there is ever something new,
something to prevent the sense of monotony growing
up in the mind.</p>

<p>The trees are not of one size, any more than of
one kind. Their maximum girth and height fall
considerably below that of the largest kauri. Still,
one may see kahikatea, kawaka, kotukutuku, matai,
miro, pukatea, puriri, rata, rimu, taraire, totara, and
many another, whose girth may be as much as
thirty feet and more, perhaps; and that may attain
a hundred feet or more of height before "heading."
Nor are these trees but so many columns. There
are trees that branch all round with great domes
of foliage. There are some that send several huge
limbs upshooting to the sky. There are crooked
trees, gnarled trees, bare trees and richly covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
ones, leaning trees and fallen trees, a confusion and
profusion of arboreal forms.</p>

<p>There is exuberant vegetation above, around,
below. Waist-deep in a rich, rare fernery you
stand, and, if you have an artistic soul, gaze
rapturously about you. From the heights you peer
down into the gullies, look abroad over distant
sweeps of river, glance through vistas of greenery,
over panoramas of wild woodland beauty, carrying
your sight away to the far-off hills bathed in sunshine;
and all is mantled with the glorious woods.</p>

<p>The mighty trunks and monster limbs of the
trees about you are covered with huge masses of
moss, shrouded in climbing ivy-ferns, festooned with
flowering creepers, and covered with natural hanging
gardens to their lofty summits. Around you are
the varied forms and colours of more than a hundred
different shrubs and trees, evergreen, and flower-bearing
in their seasons. There is the cabbage-tree
palm, with bare shank and top-knot; the nikau
palm, with weird and wondrous frondage; the
lancewood, upright and slender, with crest of copper-tinted
hair-like leaves; the fern-tree, a vast umbrella
of emerald green. There is the twisting squirming
rata; the gaunt and powerful kahikatea; the golden
kowhai; the dark velvet-covered rimu; the feathery
red tawai; the perfumy mangiao; and more that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
would take days to particularize. Flowers of bright
tint load the trees or shrubs that bear them&mdash;scarlet,
white, crimson, orange, yellow, blue; and hanging
creepers shower festooned cataracts of foliage and
blossom down from middle air. And everywhere
are ferns, ferns, ferns! abundant, luxuriant, and of
endless variety.</p>

<p>You stroll in perfect safety through this gorgeous
temple of nature. There is nothing harmful, nothing
to fear in all our paradisaic wilderness. No snake,
no scorpion, no panther; no danger from beast, or
bird, or reptile, or hostile man; nothing to cause
the apprehension of the timidest lady. Only a pig,
maybe, rushing frantically off in terror at your
approach; only a mosquito, sometimes, to remind
you you are mortal.</p>

<p>Our Brighter Britain is the natural home of the
poet and the artist. Not the least doubt about
that. We shall develop great ones some day
here. Even the Maori, originally a bloodthirsty
and ferocious savage, is deeply imbued with the
poetry of the woods. His commonest phraseology
shows it. "The month when the pohutukawa
flowers;" "the season when the kowhai is in
bloom;" so he punctuates time. And the years
that are gone he softly names "dead leaves!"</p>

<p>There are over a hundred distinct species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
trees indigenous to this country, and goodness
knows how many shrubs and other plants. Sir
J. D. Hooker has classified our flora, though doubtless
not without omissions. We, the inhabitants of
our shanty, are trying to study the natural history
of our adopted home. What we have learnt of it&mdash;not
much, perhaps, yet more than many settlers
seem to care to know&mdash;we place in our note-book,
which I now set forth for all and sundry to criticize.</p>

<p>The Kauri (<i>Dammara Australis</i>) is the king of
the forest, and must have foremost place. It has
already been described fully, in the chapter on our
special products, in which I also spoke of kauri-gum,
the Kapia of the natives.</p>

<p>The Kahikatea, "white pine" (<i>Podocarpus dacrydioides</i>),
comes next in order. It attains a hundred
and twenty feet or so of stick, and may girth nearly
forty feet. It has not much foliage, but rejoices in
great, gaunt limbs. Kahikatea bush often occupies
marshy ground, and, if unmixed, has a somewhat
bare and spectral aspect. The timber is good, but
soft, and may be used for deals.</p>

<p>The Totara (<i>Podocarpus Totara</i>) attains as great
a size. It yields a timber highly prized where kauri
cannot be got. The wood is close-grained, and
reckoned very valuable. Mottled totara is as much
esteemed for cabinet work as mottled kauri.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>The Rimu (<i>Dacrydium cupressinum</i>) is a beautiful
species of cypress; "Black Pine," as bushmen
call it. It yields a highly valued timber, used for
furniture and interior work. The tree is often as
gigantic as the kahikatea, but is stately and finely
foliaged.</p>

<p>The Tawai (<i>Fagus Menziesii</i>), called "red birch"
by settlers, is a favourite for fencing when young.
It attains a hundred feet; and yields a good strong
timber.</p>

<p>The Tawairaunui (<i>Fagus fusca</i>) is a species of
the former, known as "black birch." It is stronger
and more durable, attains a greater size, but is not
so plentiful in the North. The juice is saccharine,
like that of the American maple.</p>

<p>The Puriri (<i>Vitex littoralis</i>) is sometimes called
"teak," or "ironwood." The tree is less than the
last. The timber is hard, heavy, very durable, very
hard to work, and of a greenish colour. It is commonly
used for piles and posts, where the maximum
of toughness and durability is required.</p>

<p>The Kowhai (<i>Sophora tetraptera</i>) yields timber
similar to that of the puriri, but of somewhat
inferior quality. It is a fine tree, branching well,
and bearing a gold-coloured blossom, whose honey
attracts multitudes of tui (parson-birds) in the season.</p>

<p>The Pohutukawa (<i>Metrosideros tomentosa</i>) is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
called "the Settlers' Christmas Tree," as its scarlet
flowers appear about that time. It does not attain
more than fifty or sixty feet of height, but is bulky,
and has a rich foliage. The wood is most important,
being used for knees and ribs in ship building.
The bark is astringent, medicinal, and is used
in tanneries.</p>

<p>The Hinau (<i>Elaeocarpus dentatus</i>) produces a
good bark for tanning and dyeing. It is not among
the largest trees. The Maori used its juice as a
dye, and in the process of moku.</p>

<p>The Tanekaha (<i>Phyllocladus trichomanoides</i>) is
a larger tree again. The timber is used for planks
and spars. The bark gives a red-brown dye, formerly
used by the Maori, and is exceedingly rich
in tannin.</p>

<p>The Kamahi (<i>Weinmannia racemosa</i>) is a small
tree. It bears a pretty flower, and is a great ornament.
The bark is used in tanneries.</p>

<p>The Kohekohe (<i>Dysoxylum spectabile</i>) reaches
sixty feet. It has magnificent foliage, yields a good
timber for fencing, makes first-rate shingles, and contains
a bitter principle of tonic quality, like quassia.</p>

<p>The Kawa-kawa (<i>Piper excelsum</i>) is a large
shrub of the pepper tribe, allied to kava and cubebs.
It is ornamental, and has an aromatic scent.</p>

<p>The Pukatea (<i>Atherosperma N.Z.</i>) is a tree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the second largest class. Its timber is soft but
durable, and is much used for boat-building. It is
a remarkably handsome tree.</p>

<p>The Rata (<i>Metrosideros robusta</i>) is of the myrtle
tribe. When young it is a creeper and a parasite,
called then Ratapiki. It gradually strangles and
absorbs the tree round which it climbs, becoming
eventually a forest giant, gnarled and twisted. In
all its stages it bears a gorgeous scarlet flower.
The timber is used for rails, posts, and shingles.</p>

<p>The Ti, or "cabbage-tree palm" (<i>Cordyline
Australis</i>), grows as high as fifty feet. It branches
into various stems, each bearing a head of leaves.
The leaf yields a strong fibre. The plentiful seeds
are full of oil. The root is farinaceous, and was an
item of Maori diet. It is very abundant.</p>

<p>The Toi (<i>Cordyline indivisa</i>) is a more ornamental,
rarer, and smaller species of "cabbage-tree;"
the leaf is larger, handsomer, and also fibre-yielding.
Its root is also esculent, like that of the Ti. The
name of Toi likewise belongs to a herb (<i>Barbarea
vulgaris</i>), the leaves of which are eaten like cabbage
or spinach.</p>

<p>The Tingahere, or "lancewood" (<i>Cordyline
stricta</i>), is another species of the same family. It is
of very singular appearance, its head resembling a
tuft of copper-coloured feathers or hair. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
several more members of this tribe to be seen pretty
frequently in the mixed bush.</p>

<p>The Nikau (<i>Areca sapida</i>) attains forty or fifty
feet. It is a handsome palm, bearing enormous
fronds, often fifteen feet or more in length. They
are used for thatching wharès in the forest. Within
the crown of the leaves is an edible pith, a stick
of pinky-white stuff, the size of a man's arm, eating
like celery and cocoa-nut in combination; it is
refreshing and wholesome.</p>

<p>The Tawhera or Kie-kie (<i>Freycinetia Banksii</i>)
appears to be sometimes a parasite, sometimes a
shrub, and sometimes a small tree. It is a curious
plant, with tufts of stringy leaves. It bears a fruit
very much esteemed by the Maori, which resembles
a green pine-apple, small, and eats like honey and
cream.</p>

<p>The Koraka (<i>Corynocarpus levigata</i>) was brought
to New Zealand by the Maori. It is a small tree,
with fine, dark, glossy foliage, which cattle are very
fond of. The fruit is edible; the kernel containing
"korakine," a narcotic poison. This property, however,
appears to be dissipated by heat, as I have
known the kernels to be roasted, ground, and made
into coffee, without bad result.</p>

<p>The Maire (<i>Santalum Cunninghamii</i>) is not a
large tree, but the wood is extremely hard, heavy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
and finely grained. It was used by the Maori for
war-clubs, and is now sawn and utilized for many
purposes. Bushmen call it "Black Maire," to distinguish
it from the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Maire-tawhake (<i>Eugenia Maire</i>), or "White
Maire."</p>

<p>The Maire-aunui (<i>Olea Cunninghamii</i>), which,
together with the last, is a much bigger tree than
the maire, but does not yield such valuable timber.</p>

<p>The Kotukutuku (<i>Fuchsia excorticata</i>) is akin
to the fuchsia seen in gardens at home. It is here
a huge tree, standing eighty feet in height, and with
great girth. The flower is fine, and the fruit agreeable
eating.</p>

<p>The Kawaka (<i>Libocedrus Doniana</i>) is a grand
tree of the largest class. Its timber is dark and
heavy, but is too brittle to work well. It serves
some purposes, however.</p>

<p>The Mangiao (<i>Tetranthera calicaris</i>) is a smaller
tree, but one that yields a timber exceptionally useful
to carpenters and joiners. It is also largely used
in the ship-yards. The wood is fragrant with an
aromatic odour, as is also the leaf and blossom.</p>

<p>The Matai, or "Red Pine" (<i>Podocarpus spicata</i>),
needs special mention. Its wood is durable; soft
when fresh, it has the property of hardening with
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>The Miro, "Black Pine" (<i>Podocarpus ferruginea</i>),
is, like the matai, a large-sized tree. Its
timber is close-grained and durable, but is somewhat
brittle.</p>

<p>The Ake-ake (<i>Dodonæa viscosa</i>) gives a handsome
wood for cabinet work, which is said to be
imperishable.</p>

<p>The Horopito, or "Pepper-tree" (<i>Drimys axillaris</i>)
yields also an ornamental timber. Though
the tree is of small size its wood is useful for
veneers. Its fruit, leaves, and bark contain
medicinal properties.</p>

<p>The Ohoeka (<i>Panax crassifolium</i>) is a small
shrub-like tree, whose wood is noted for singular
lightness, flexibility, and elasticity.</p>

<p>The Manuka or Manukau (<i>Leptospermum scoparium,
et ericoides</i>), is the "ti-tree" of settlers. In
one condition it is low shrubbery, not unlike heather,
called then Rawiri by the Maori. "Second-growth
ti-tree" is like a plantation of cane, coming up very
densely. This brushwood is useful for small purposes
about a house. It develops into wattles and
stakes after twenty years or so; these are of great
value for fencing. Finally, the plant becomes one
of the largest forest-trees, yielding a hard, close-grained
timber. There are red and white varieties.
The Maori particularize it as Kahikatea, when in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
tree condition. A sort of manna, which exudes from
the plant in all stages, is called by them Piamanuka.
Ti-tree springs upon any land that has been cleared
or burnt, and comes up densely and rapidly. It is the
chief weed the pioneer farmer has to contend with.</p>

<p>The Tawa (<i>Nesodaphne Tawa</i>) grows to nearly
as great a size as the kahikatea, though branching
and spreading more. Its timber, however, is soft
and not of value.</p>

<p>The Taraire (<i>Nesodaphne Taraire</i>) is a huge
and handsome tree of a kindred species. Like the
tawa, its wood is light and brittle. The berries of
both are eaten, usually after having been boiled.</p>

<p>The Whau (<i>Entelea arborescens</i>) is a small tree,
noticeable for its fine foliage. The wood is light,
and the tree yields a fair substitute for cork.</p>

<p>The Whau-whau-paku (<i>Panax arborea</i>) is similarly
to be noticed for its elegant glossy leaf.</p>

<p>The Patate (<i>Schefflera digitata</i>) is another small
tree remarkable on the same account.</p>

<p>The Piripiriwhata (<i>Carpodetus serratus</i>) grows to
about thirty feet in height. The timber is something
like that of the ash, and is excellent for axe-handles,
cart-shafts, etc.</p>

<p>The Rama-rama (<i>Myrtus bullata</i>) has a good
hard wood, but is small. Its pink flower is a great
ornament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>The Raukawa (<i>Panax Edgerleyi</i>) is a larger
ornamental tree.</p>

<p>The Rewa-rewa (<i>Knightia excelsa</i>) approaches
to the second class of the great trees. It is often
a hundred feet in height, but the trunk is slender.
Its wood has a splendidly showy grain for cabinet
work.</p>

<p>The Tarata (<i>Pittosporum eugenioides</i>) is a small
tree noted for its purple blossom.</p>

<p>The Tawairauriki (<i>Fagus Solandri</i>) is the
"White Birch" of settlers. It reaches upwards of
a hundred feet; but its timber is inferior and less
durable than that of either the red or black varieties.</p>

<p>The Titoki (<i>Alectryon excelsum</i>) is one of the
larger trees. Its timber is strong, tough, and
durable. Its seed is full of a fine fixed oil, which
the Maori used to extract and employ as an unguent.</p>

<p>The Manawa, or "mangrove" (<i>Avicennia officinalis</i>),
is very plentiful in the north, along the shores
of tidal waters. The wood is found useful for some
minor purposes, and might be used as a source of
crude soda, perhaps.</p>

<p>The Ngaio (<i>Myoporum laetum</i>) is a small bushy
tree, capable of being grown into hedges.</p>

<p>The Neinei (<i>Dracophyllum latifolium</i>) is but
a small tree. The wood is hard, and is valued for
making mallets and the handles of implements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>The Mapau (<i>Myrsine Urvillei</i>) affords good
material for fencing.</p>

<p>The Mapauriki (<i>Pittosporum tenuifolium</i>) has
handsome foliage, and a dark purple flower, and can
be grown as a shelter tree.</p>

<p>The Kaiwhiria (<i>Hedycarya dentata</i>) is remarkable
on the same account.</p>

<p>The Houhere (<i>Populnea Hoheria</i>) is a fine large
tree of the linden kind. Like that tree, its inner
bark may be utilized for bass and matting. The
flower is snow-white, and very handsome.</p>

<p>The Kaikomako (<i>Pennantia corymbosa</i>) will be
much cultivated as a garden ornament. The flower
is sweet-scented, and the fruit is edible.</p>

<p>This comprises the catalogue of native trees, so
far as they are known in our shanty; but, it is said
that there are nearly as many more varieties indigenous
to the country, though considerably scarcer
than any of those mentioned.</p>

<p>There are some shrubs noticeable for one reason
and another. We are in the habit of collecting the
seeds of such as have remarkably handsome blooms
or leafage, and sending them home for our friends
to try and raise in their conservatories. A few of
our trees and shrubs will bear the English climate,
if properly attended to. I have seen fair specimens
in botanical gardens. Still, they will never attain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
their full proportions there. Our favourite flowering
or foliage shrubs are these:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Akakura (<i>Metrosideros scandens</i>), a beautiful
climber, which will develop into a tree if allowed to
grow. It bears flowers like tufts of crimson silk.</p>

<p>The Akepiro (<i>Olearia furfuracea</i>), a shrub with
velvety foliage.</p>

<p>The Angi-angi (<i>Geniostoma ligustrifolium</i>), a
shrub with a white flower.</p>

<p>The Kaikaiatua (<i>Rhabdothamnus Solandri</i>). The
Maori evidently appreciated some part of this plant,
the name of it signifying "Food of Gods," precisely
the same title by which the old Greeks spoke of
certain dainty mushrooms. It has a fine orange
and red-striped blossom.</p>

<p>The Kapuka (<i>Griselinia littoralis</i>), a small tree
with a yellow-green foliage.</p>

<p>The Karamu or Papaumu (<i>Coprosma</i>, <i>sp.</i>), a
family of pretty flowering shrubs.</p>

<p>The Karetu (<i>Hierochloe redolens</i>), which is not
a shrub exactly, but a grass, renowned for its
delicious scent.</p>

<p>The Kihi-kihi (<i>Pittosporum crassifolium</i>), a
shrub with purple flowers, akin to the mapauriki.</p>

<p>The Kohia (<i>Passiflora tetandra</i>), the seeds of
which yield a bland oil, that may probably be some
day utilized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>The Korokio (<i>Corokia Buddleoides</i>), a fine erect
tree, bearing a conspicuous red berry.</p>

<p>The Koromiko (<i>Veronica</i>, <i>sp.</i>), these pretty
species are astringent, and their shoots are a remedy
for scouring in cattle.</p>

<p>The Kotukutuku (<i>Fuchsia excorticata</i>), when
full-grown, it becomes one of the largest trees.</p>

<p>The Kowhaingutukaka (<i>Clianthus puniceus</i>),
bears especially fine red and orange blossoms.</p>

<p>The Kumerahu (<i>Pomaderris elliptica</i>), is sweet-scented.</p>

<p>The Mairehau (<i>Phebalium nudum</i>), grows well.</p>

<p>The Oho (<i>Panax Lessonii</i>), is recommended,
but we do not admire it.</p>

<p>The Pere (<i>Alseuosmia Banksii</i>), a straggling,
spreading bush.</p>

<p>The Pikiarero (<i>Clematis indivisa</i>), is very plentiful
in the forest. It has fine white, sweet-scented
flowers.</p>

<p>The Ratapiki (<i>Metrosideros Florida</i>), is a species
much the same as the akakura.</p>

<p>The Rohutu (<i>Myrtus pedunculata</i>), is pretty.</p>

<p>The Toro (<i>Persoonia Toro</i>), becomes a tree. It
has rich foliage.</p>

<p>Besides these there are one or two climbers and
shrubs that are plentiful everywhere, and must be
noticed for other peculiarities. They are these:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>The Kareao (<i>Rhipogonum scandens</i>), well-known
to settlers under the detested name of "supple-jack."
It grows in long, winding canes, the thickness
of one's finger, and so horny that they will
turn an axe-edge. It often binds acres of trees
together in impenetrable thickets, making the bushman's
labour excessively difficult. Walking-stick
makers export selected canes, and they are split and
used as withes. The root is astringent, and is said
to resemble sarsaparilla in medicinal virtue.</p>

<p>The Tataramoa (<i>Rubus Australis</i>) is equally well-known
under the designation of "bush-lawyer." Its
stems are flexile, and more like rope than cane, but
every part of the plant is fibrous and very strong.
It grows in much the same manner as supple-jack,
but is luckily not quite so plentiful. It rejoices in
abundant foliage, and each leaf is armed with hooked
thorns, which lay hold of anything attempting to
brush past them. Hence the name; for it is needful
to disengage each particular thorn with care and
circumspection. There is no pulling away from a
bush-lawyer, unless one is prepared to leave clothes
and skin hanging on the bush, so tenacious is its
hold. The plant belongs to the bramble tribe, and
has a white flower and a red berry.</p>

<p>The Mounga-mounga (<i>Lygodium articulatum</i>) is
the delight of persons camping out. It has a stem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
like small twine, which depends from the trees in
immense bundles of spiral coils. Bunches of it
make capital bedding, being, in fact, a natural spring-mattress.</p>

<p>The Tupakihi (<i>Coriaria ruscifolia</i>) is a shrub
growing chiefly on poor open land. The whole
plant is highly astringent, but is also said to contain
a narcotic principle. Cattle occasionally eat it, and
get poisoned. It bears bunches of juicy berries
which are wholesome to eat, but upon them is a
seed that is dangerously full of the poisonous principle.
The beverage called tutu, which the old
Maori esteemed, was made from the berries of this
plant. When it was boiled with a certain seaweed
(<i>Porphyra</i>) a nutritious jelly was formed.
Tutu was probably not universally known among
the Maori, but only to certain tribes. It appears
to have been intoxicating, for warriors who required
a "drop of somethink short" were accustomed to
imbibe it on the eve of battle.</p>

<p>New Zealand is well-known to be a great place
for ferns. They exist in incredible profusion everywhere.
Botanists have enumerated a hundred and
thirty indigenous species, of which some forty are
peculiar to the country. We are always sending
roots, seeds, and dried species home, but I cannot
attempt to catalogue them. Several kinds resem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>bling
that beautifully delicate fern called the maidenhair
are among our commonest species. Their
luxuriance is astonishing. They cover acres and
acres of ground in the bush, and come up to one's
waist and armpits.</p>

<p>The Tuakura (<i>Dicksonia squarrosa</i>) and the
Ponga (<i>Cyathea dealbata</i>) are the two principal
varieties of fern-tree. Groves of them, overshadowing
some lonely creek, at the bottom of a wild,
wooded gully, are indeed a sight to see. Growing
to twenty, thirty, or forty feet in height, the graceful
drooping fronds that spread around a single tree
form a natural arbour, capable of sheltering a
number of persons.</p>

<p>The Raurau (<i>Pteris aquilina</i>, <i>var. esculenta</i>) is
a fern of the nature of English bracken. It
covers all the better-class open lands, and occurs
among the undergrowth of the bush. It sometimes
grows very large, the fronds overtopping one's head
as one walks or rides through it. The root is a
Maori edible.</p>

<p>The ivy-ferns, climbing-ferns, or creeper-ferns
(<i>Polypodia</i>, <i>sp.</i>, <i>Hymenophylla</i>, <i>sp.</i>), are very beautiful.
They are everywhere in the bush, ascending
to the tops of the tallest trees, twining on every
limb, and throwing out bunches of fronds to hide
it. Some have broad, glossy leaves as big as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
table-top; others are digitate, pedatisect, tripinnate,
and all the rest of it, or assume strange new shapes,
like that of the kidney-fern (<i>Trichomanes reniforme</i>),
for instance.</p>

<p>Like the ferns, the mosses of the country are
legion in number, and marvellously luxuriant in
growth. They, too, are everywhere. Great masses
of moss form hanging-gardens on the trees; for,
collecting a quantity of detritus and moisture, a sort
of soil is formed, in which small ferns, tawhera,
orchids, plants of various kinds, and fungi, flourish.
In and about these hanging-gardens, these ferneries
high up upon the great trees, are the homes and
habitations of birds, rats, bees, beetles, lizards, and
butterflies.</p>

<p>The Harakeke or Korati (<i>Phormium tenax</i>) is
the justly celebrated New Zealand flax. It is
plentiful everywhere, on bush-land and open-land,
rich soil and poor soil, hill and dale, from the
Reinga to the Bluff. Throughout the North you
cannot go a hundred yards in any direction without
seeing a clump of it. In many districts of both
islands it covers hundreds of acres entirely.</p>

<p>Flax resembles the English flag, or iris, in
appearance, but the blades are thicker, heavier, and
glossy. Usually, from four to six feet long, in
favourable situations they grow to ten or twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
feet. The colour is a bright green, variegated in
some of the species with white, yellow, or red. The
plant grows in dense clumps, or bushes, and from
the centre of each root rises a tall stem bearing
flowers, white, yellow, salmon, flesh-pink, red, in
different varieties. The flowers are peculiarly rich
in honey; and Maori children are fond of sucking
them. The resulting seed is oily and resinous, the
seed-stems being commonly used for torches.</p>

<p>The leaves of the harakeke are composed of a
strong fibre, which ranks next to silk in degree of
tenacity. The whole plant is impregnated with
gum, quantities of which are found about the base
of the leaves. The gum is astringent, and the root
is rich in tannin. This fresh gum was used by the
Maori for every purpose of cement and glue. The
root had its place in their pharmacopeia.</p>

<p>From the earliest times that Europeans had
any knowledge of New Zealand, this flax-fibre has
excited great attention. The quality of the Maori
manufactures from it was sufficient to arouse earnest
inquiry into the nature of the material. The robes
and dresses they wove out of phormium yarn were
articles often of considerable beauty, finish, and
design. The kaitaka, for instance, made from a
choice variety of flax, has a gloss like silk or satin,
and, though thick, is perfectly soft and flexible. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
these garments were so durable that they could be
handed down from generation to generation.</p>

<p>But the labour involved in making these articles
was prodigious, and would have rendered them
above all price in a community where an individual's
time was commutable into cash. The fibre was
separated by hand, and freed from the all-permeating
gum by toilsome manipulative processes. This work
of freeing the fibre from gum has always been the
great difficulty. Even yet success has not been
wholly achieved. No European machinery or process
has yet been perfected that will turn out an
article like the Maori manufacture, and at a practicable
cost. If it could be done, the fabric would
bring immense wealth to this country.</p>

<p>Very early in this century phormium fibre was
brought to Sydney and to England. The manufacture
of cloth from it was essayed at Knaresborough,
in Yorkshire, but it was found that the
fibre was destroyed by boiling it with chemicals,
which had been resorted to for removal of the gum.
However, it soon became known as of value for
cordage, canvas, and paper-making. Phormium rope,
tested against the best Manilla rope, bulk for bulk,
has been over and over again proved the stronger
and most durable.</p>

<p>Many mills have been erected, and much capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
sunk in the production of the dressed fibre, and in
experimenting to render it more workable at commensurate
cost. In the North less has been done
in this way than elsewhere. There are mills at
Whangarei, at Aratapu, and at sundry other places;
but it is evident that further south must lie the
chief fields of flax industry. In Taranaki and in
Westland, for example, there are miles and miles of
nothing but flax. The supply of leaf is there simply
inexhaustible.</p>

<p>In the commercial world New Zealand flax-fibre
was highly esteemed at one time, but has fallen out
of favour. During 1873 the colony exported dressed
fibre to the value of £143,799, but in 1875 this
export fell to £11,742, and, though it has recovered
slightly, it has not reached the original standard.
This has been owing to the action of English rope-makers,
who continue to prefer Manilla hemp, and
to depreciate the price of our product, in spite of its
acknowledged superiority. A short-sighted policy
on their part, it promises to result well for the
colony. Unable to find a market for the raw
material, New Zealanders are beginning to manufacture
rope, canvas, and paper themselves. There is
not a doubt that their products will take the foremost
place, and bring great wealth to the country.</p>

<p>Experimenting with flax has been a regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
craze. Many a man has lost all his capital in it.
You have only to see what the Maori have done
with the fibre, and to recognize the enormous supply
of the material, to get bitten by this mania. It
seems so manifestly certain that there must be a
way of working up the material by machinery at
a reasonable cost, and producing a fabric such as
the Maori did, which could be sold at a profit.
Only find out the way to do it, and the fortunes
that could be made would be boundless in extent.</p>

<p>In the green state, the flax leaf is most useful to
both settler and Maori. Every purpose for which
cordage of any kind is wanted, is easily supplied
by cutting some leaves from the nearest clump,
splitting and tying them together. They look unsightly,
but they are just as strong as need be.
Whether it is a bridle, a halter, a boat-cable, or a
boot-lace that is required, green flax-leaf out of the
nearest bush supplies it. And the Maori plait kits
and baskets for all purposes with it.</p>

<p>Take it altogether, in the green state and in the
manufactured condition, in the present and prospectively,
as what it has been and what it will
become, there is nothing in the country to equal
the value of the phormium. Few countries have
a natural product so useful, and of such vast importance
to their future welfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>The vegetable edibles of the bush have already
been alluded to in the description of Maori manners.
There would be no need for any one to starve, if
he were lost in the forest for months, did he but
know the native esculents, even if he were unable
to supplement them by catching birds or fish.
Almost every Maori&mdash;at any rate of the old school&mdash;is
a good practical botanist and naturalist. He
knows the properties and native name of every
plant; and he knows the habits of each bird, or fish,
or insect, and how to catch it. When the Pakeha
condescends to go to the Maori for instruction in
these particulars, he will be sure to gain something
by it.</p>

<p>The principal edible, because the most widespread,
was the fern-root. It was prepared in
several ways. The most elaborate consisted in
macerating, steaming, and kneading the gummy
fibrous stuff, and keeping the resulting mess until a
kind of fermentation began in it. The readiest way
was to simply roast the scraped root, then to beat it
into softness between two stones. When cold, this
last became hard like biscuit. It is tolerably
nutritious, but not particularly nice, according to
Pakeha notions.</p>

<p>The root of the ti, and of the toi, too, I believe,
is far better food, but was neither so plentiful nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
so easily grubbed up. Baked or boiled it is not
bad eating, being very farinaceous. The earliest
missionary settlers made beer from a wort of it.
Whether this was known to the Maori previous to
the advent of the Pakeha, I have been unable to
discover.</p>

<p>The pith of the nikau is wholesome, nutritious,
and palatable. The tree is plentiful enough in the
North. Unlike the root of the cabbage-tree just
mentioned, it is eaten raw. There is a bushy grass
(<i>Gahnia</i> and <i>Cladium</i>), strong spiny stuff, in the
forest, which also has an edible pith.</p>

<p>The root of the raupo (<i>Typha angustifolia</i>), the
swamp-grass of which the Maori construct their
wharè, is edible, similarly to that of the cabbage-tree.
Punga-punga, the pollen of the raupo, used
to be made into bread.</p>

<p>There are one or two other roots and piths also
esculent, but neither so good nor so plentiful as those
just recorded. There are the fruits of the hinau,
rimu, matai, miro, kahikatea, koraka, tawa, kohekohe,
taraire, tawhera, and other trees and shrubs. And
there is the interior of the stem of one of the fern
trees.</p>

<p>There are the native spinach or Renga-renga
(<i>Tetragonia expansa</i>), the Pana-pana, or cress (<i>Cardamine
hirsuta</i>), and the Reti-reti, or sorrel (<i>Oxalis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
magellanica</i>), which do for salad and green vegetables.
As they are plentiful, they might be more freely used
by settlers and bushmen than they are.</p>

<p>To them may be added the Toi (<i>Barbarea
vulgaris</i>), a herb which served the ancient Maori as
cabbage. Then there is a native celery (<i>Apium
australe</i>), a nettle (<i>Urtica incisa</i>), and a dandelion
(<i>Taraxacum dens-leonis</i>), all of which might be
eaten. The Maori also made use of the root of an
orchid (<i>Gastrodia Cunninghamii</i>), and the root of a
bindweed (<i>Convolvulus sepium</i>). They called the
first Hirituriti, and the latter Panake. These roots
are farinaceous and nourishing, and were baked and
consumed in large quantities.</p>

<p>The three plants cultivated by the Maori&mdash;Kumera
(<i>Ipomœa Batatas</i>), Hue (<i>Cucurbita</i>, <i>sp.</i>),
and Taro (<i>Caladium esculentum</i>), are all to be found
growing wild. There are also now to be found wild
many of our garden vegetables, including the potato,
tomato, capsicum, tobacco, cabbage, cape gooseberry
(<i>Physalis Peruviana</i>), watercress&mdash;called Kowhiti by
the natives&mdash;and many more.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Maori made use of several seaweeds
and a number of fungi. But, as Britons at home
persist in despising all other fungi but the field
mushroom and the truffle, I suppose they will hardly
take to such food here, dainty though it is. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
fungus (<i>Hirneola</i>, <i>sp.</i>) is gathered here to a small
extent for export to China. It fetches about 15<i>s.</i> to
£1 per cwt., and about £1000 worth are annually
exported. It grows plentifully on certain trees. The
field mushroom (<i>Agaricus campestris</i>), well known in
England, has appeared on our paddocks, sometimes
in enormous quantities. Together with its congener
the horse-mushroom (<i>A. arvensis</i>), this fungus is not
indigenous, according to Maori information on the
subject. I have heard the species called "Harori-kai-pakeha,"
which conveys the idea that the field
mushroom is an introduced species. But the Maori
applied the name of Harori to several species
belonging to the families <i>Agaricus</i>, <i>Amanita</i>, <i>Lepiota</i>,
etc., which we call "toadstools." They were accustomed
to eat certain of these, and do so still, if
they happen to find them in the bush. All fungi
growing on trees they call Hakeke, or Popoiahakeke.
Of these, they were accustomed to eat the three or
four species of <i>Hirneola</i>, which are indigenous, and
one or two <i>Polypori</i> besides. One of the latter
tribe yielded them a surgical appliance. A mushroom
they name Putawa, is a <i>Boletus</i>. Probably
more than one species of this family was customarily
eaten. The Maori also ate the Pukurau (<i>Lycoperdon
Fontainesii</i>), and possibly other species of puff-balls
besides. They knew the esculent value of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Pekepekekiore (<i>Hydnum Clathroides</i>), but their
chiefest dainty and most esteemed treasure among
fungi, is the Paruwhatitiri, or "thunder-dirt"
(<i>Ileodictyon cibarium</i>). The volva of this extraordinary
fungus is eaten, and is regarded as a great
dainty. There are many species of fleshy fungi in
the bush, but little is known of them, either by
Maori, settlers, or scientists.</p>

<p>New Zealand did without quadrupeds in the old
times, save and except the kiore, or rat. This was
a delicacy much esteemed by Maori bon-vivants,
and was regularly hunted by them with great ceremonial.
It is rapidly becoming extinct, only being
found now in the remote recesses of the forest.
The Norwegian rat, which centuries ago exterminated
the aboriginal British rat, has somehow come over
here with the Pakeha, and is rapidly rendering the
kiore a thing of the past, while spreading through
the land in its place.</p>

<p>There was some talk of the discovery of a kind
of otter, but, I believe, that has been proved a myth
altogether. There were some bats, and there was
the dog, kararehe or peropero. The kararehe, however,
was never wild to any extent. It had been
brought here by the Maori, and was kept domesticated
by them. They prized its flesh for food, and
its skin for robes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Cook's pigs are now numerous everywhere,
as has been described in another chapter.
Besides them, cattle, goats, sheep, and cats are now
found wild in certain localities, and in considerable
number.</p>

<p>We have, luckily, no snakes, and the only reptiles
are pretty little ngarara, or lizards (<i>Mocoa zelandica</i>,
and <i>M. ornata</i>), together with a few frogs in some
districts. The Maori have legends respecting
enormous ngarara that they say once existed here.
They have a tale of these taniwha which is somewhat
parallel to our nursery stories of dragons.</p>

<p>Instead of animals New Zealand possessed an
extraordinary class of gigantic birds, the famous
moa, in fact. The kiwi (<i>Apteryx</i>) remains as an
example of this family. The kiwi, of which there
are four known species, varies from the size of a
common hen to that of a goose. It has neither
wings nor tail; and its dull brown feathers resemble
coarse hair. It has a long flexible bill, and thick
powerful legs, which divide into four strong claws.</p>

<p>The kiwi is a night-bird, lying hid by day. It is
very shy, disappearing from the neighbourhood of
settlements and haunting the recesses of the forest,
where I have found it to be still very plentiful. The
kiwi lays a very large egg in proportion to its size.
A bird of four and a half pounds will lay an egg of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
fourteen ounces weight. The Maori used to catch
considerable numbers of them, and do still in some
parts, using their flesh for food, their skins for
leather, and their feathers for weaving into chiefs'
robes. Having eaten kiwi old and young, baked
and boiled, roast and fried, I am able to state that
its meat is tougher and more tasteless than barbecued
boot-soles.</p>

<p>The Maori have two ways of catching kiwi.
They hunt them with dogs trained to the work; that
is one method. The dog flushes the kiwi, which
runs swiftly and silently off among the undergrowth.
The dog follows by scent. At last the kiwi is driven
into some swamp, where it half buries itself in the
mud, and stupidly stands till it is caught.</p>

<p>Another plan is to light a fire by night in some
secluded and likely thicket, the hunter lying concealed
near. He imitates the cry of the kiwi, and
so lures it to the fire, where it stands dazzled and
stupefied till he seizes it. A party I was out with
once caught a dozen birds so one night.</p>

<p>The now extinct moa appear to have been very
similar to kiwi, only of gigantic size. Plenty of their
skeletons are found, enabling naturalists to tell us all
about them, corroborated by the tradition of the
Maori. They seem to have been in existence up to
the end of last century, and, till lately, it was thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
that individual specimens might even yet be found
in unexplored localities. This hope no longer
remains.</p>

<p>There were three families of moa (<i>Dinornis</i>,
<i>Aptornis</i>, <i>Palapteryx</i>), subdivided into several
species. The smallest was five feet, and the largest
sixteen feet in height. They were of enormous
bulk, too; one species had legs thicker than a
man's thigh. But huge as they were, they were shy
and stupid, and not formidable, so that the Maori
were able to run them down and club them to
death.</p>

<p>If the moa's egg was as large in proportion to
the bird as the kiwi's is to it, it must have been a
monster. And if, as naturalists lead us to infer, the
moa was but a magnified kiwi in all respects, it is
to be supposed that its flesh would be correspondingly
tougher and coarser. In that case, I do not
see why the Maori should be blamed for turning
cannibal in preference to eating it.</p>

<p>The first voyagers to New Zealand speak with
special unction of the multitudes of birds, and
especially of singing birds. They could scarcely do
so now. The native birds have noticeably diminished
in number, though they are yet to be found plentifully
enough in the remote bush. The Maori say in
their picturesque manner&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"When the big Pakeha bird (ship) swam upon
the sea to Ahinamaui, the little Maori birds flew
away."</p>

<p>Some have thought that the introduction of
honey-bees has caused the disappearance of honey-sucking
birds. A more probable reason is that
advanced by Dr. Buller, namely, that the Norwegian
rat is the real cause. This little beast swarms
throughout the forest country, and robs nests of
eggs and young.</p>

<p>But the Maori birds are by no means so few in
number as some writers would have us believe; and
they are being rapidly augmented by numerous
species from other countries, imported and acclimatized,
which are thriving apace and multiplying
prodigiously. I shall only have room to mention a
few of our native species, such as are peculiarly
noticeable or comparatively common.</p>

<p>The Tui (<i>Prosthemadera N.Z.</i>) is commonly
known as "parson-bird," from two white projecting
feathers on the neck, which exactly parody a clergyman's
falling bands. It is somewhat larger than the
English starling, with plumage resembling it, but
more metallic in colour and glossier. It sucks honey
from flowers, and eats berries. It has a cheerful
song, and can imitate like a mocking-bird. I have
often seen scores of tui at a time on blossoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
kowhai trees. Tui give regular concerts in the early
morning, and the motions of the bird when singing
resemble those of a preacher, a curious addition to
the likeness conveyed by its "bands." Tui fatten
so excessively on phormium seeds, that the Maori
have a fable that they peck a hole in their breasts,
to let the superfluous oil out. The bird is a
favourite for caging, both with Maori and settlers.
It can be taught to whistle tunes and articulate
words. It is good eating.</p>

<p>The Kuku (<i>Carpophaga N.Z.</i>) is a wood-pigeon,
a good deal larger than the English species. It has
splendid plumage, of a dark, flashing, metallic green,
with touches of red, and a white breast. It appears
to be migratory, coming down in flocks every now
and then, especially when the cabbage trees are in
seed. On these oily beans it gets absurdly fat, like
the tui, so much so, that when you shoot a bird and
it falls to the ground, you find the skin split, and the
fat oozing forth. The kuku appear in hundreds and
thousands sometimes, and numbers may easily be
shot. The Maori snare them and spear them by
scores. They are capital eating.</p>

<p>The Weka (<i>Ocydromus Earli</i>) is found plentifully
in the woods. Settlers call it the "bush-hen." It
has a pretty mottled plumage of partridge tints,
and its flesh eats like grouse. The weka is some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>what
larger than the English water-hen. It is
getting less abundant every year. There is a larger
bird in the bush of kindred species, rarer, and distinguished
by more showy colours, which I have
seen once or twice, but could not identify. Probably
it may have been a cross between the weka and the
common domestic fowl.</p>

<p>The Pukeko (<i>Porphyrio melanotus</i>) is a splendid
water-bird, larger than the biggest duck. It is
known as the "swamp-hen." Its purple colouring
and crimson beak give it quite a royal and magnificent
appearance. This bird is getting rapidly
more numerous instead of the contrary. It has
quite taken to Pakeha domination, apparently, and
could probably be domesticated. The pukeko was
brought here by the Maori. It is fine eating.</p>

<p>The Kaka (<i>Nestor meridionalis</i>) is a large bird
of the parrot kind. Its plumage is of a greenish
brown, with scarlet under the wings. It is common
and good eating. There are several varieties of
kaka, some in which the colouring is dull, and others
in which it is richly variegated. It eats insects and
berries, and sucks the honey from flowers. Its note
is harsh and clamorous.</p>

<p>The Kakariki (<i>Platycercus N.Z.</i>) comprehend
several species of small parrot or parrakeet. They
are distinguished by brilliant emerald-green and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
scarlet feathers. Occasionally a good many may be
seen. They are noisy fellows&mdash;like all parrots.</p>

<p>The Kuimako or Kohorimako (<i>Anthornis melanura</i>)
is a bird about the size of a thrush. Its
plumage is olive-green, with purple about the head.
It has a sweet note, that has been compared to
the tinkling and chiming of silver bells; hence its
common name, "the bell-bird." It is our nightingale.
Once chorusing in flocks, singing at daybreak, it
may still be often heard, but, sad to say, is getting
scarcer.</p>

<p>The Kahu (<i>Circus Gouldi</i>) is chief among
several of the hawk tribe. It looks almost eagle-like,
as its broad wings skim across the sky. It
is a sad marauder among the settler's poultry.
Sometimes two or three of them will combine and
attack a turkey or lamb. They do good by keeping
down rats on open ground.</p>

<p>The Ruru (<i>Spiloglaux N.Z.</i>) is a small brown
owl, heard everywhere at night. It is called the
"morepork," from its doleful iteration of apparently
that word. There is also a singular green owl-parrot,
the kakapo (<i>Strigops habroptilus</i>), which
lives in holes in the ground. It attacks sheep
and tears their backs. It does not belong to our
catalogue, as it is not found in the Land of the
Kauri, principally inhabiting Canterbury and Otago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
I believe there are one or two other species of owls
besides them.</p>

<p>The Kaiaia (<i>Hieracidea Brunnea</i>) is a sparrow-hawk,
smaller than the kahu. It will probably have
its work cut out in keeping down the English
sparrows that have been introduced, and are likely
to get too numerous. By the same native name
the "quail-hawk" (<i>Hieracidea N.Z.</i>) is also known.
Both of these hawks are so exceedingly fierce that
they will attack anything, either singly or in concert.
They have even been known to fly at men, and to
pounce at game in their hands.</p>

<p>The Patatai (<i>Rallus Philippensis</i>) is a small
land-rail, plumaged much like a partridge. It may
not infrequently be seen; and makes a dainty dish.</p>

<p>The Matuku (<i>Botaurus pœciloptilus</i>) is a bittern,
long-legged and billed. It is of dull hues, and its
monotonous boom may be heard from the swamps.
The Maori are expert at catching them; but I cannot
say that bittern-meat is good. There is a smaller
species of bittern, a blue heron, and possibly others
of the family, all known under the common name of
matuku.</p>

<p>The Kotare (<i>Halcyon vagans</i>) is a kingfisher,
whose bright plumage flits continually through the
mangroves, where it principally makes its home. It
is larger than our English species, and of much the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
same hues, sea-green and ultramarine, with orange-tawny
under the wings.</p>

<p>The Kawau (<i>Phalacrocorax</i>, <i>sp.</i>) is one of the
commonest birds. There are half a dozen distinct
species, known to us by the general name of shag or
cormorant. They have a black back and a white
breast. Some have blue, green, and other tints of
colouring. They build in trees, in large "shaggeries,"
and haunt the seashore and the banks of the rivers.</p>

<p>The Kuaka (<i>Limosa Baueri</i>) is the bird spoken
of as "curlew" and "grey snipe" by colonists.
Large flocks are to be seen on our rivers, feeding on
the mud-banks. When they are assembled in
numbers, it is often possible to creep cautiously
within range, and take a pot-shot at the crowd as it
rises. A number may thus be bagged. The Maori
used to net them by night. They are fairly good
eating.</p>

<p>The Titi or "mutton-bird" (<i>Puffinus brevicaudus</i>)
is a species of petrel common throughout the South
Sea. They breed in burrows far inland, consorting
in immense flocks. An island in Bass' Straits is
resorted to by them annually, in such incredible
numbers, that one estimate, arrived at by calculating
the cubic space they occupied, gave a hundred and
fifty millions as their probable numbers. On our
coasts they often come in legions. The Maori<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
catch them by stretching nets along the seashore at
night. The birds, flying low, and returning after
dark to their inland roosting-places, are thus trapped
in great quantities. The Maori used to preserve
them in calabashes, partly cooked, and potted in the
oily fat that had exuded from them. They were
thus made into a sort of "canned provisions," which
might be stored up against times of dearth, or made
an article of trade with inland tribes.</p>

<p>The Koreke (<i>Coturnix N.Z.</i>), the native quail,
was once very plentiful, though more so on the
grassy downs of the south than here. The natives
used to net koreke in great quantities, much as they
did the titi and kuaka. Now, the bird is scarce in
our part of the country. Only rarely do we see a
flock of half a dozen or so. But their place is amply
filled by various imported species of game-birds,
now getting very plentiful.</p>

<p>The Huia (<i>Heteralocha Gouldi</i>) must just be
mentioned, as it is one of the most striking of New
Zealand species. It is only found in the mountains
of Wellington and Nelson provinces, consequently
not in our districts. The huia is a large bird, of a
uniform glossy black colour, shot with green. It
has a long bent bill, and brilliant orange wattles.</p>

<p>The Koheperoa (<i>Eudynamis Taitensis</i>) is a long-tailed,
brown-plumaged cuckoo, which comes here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
from the South Sea Islands in the month of October&mdash;our
May. Its habits appear to be much the
same as those of the English cuckoo. I only once
saw one closely, but have heard them oftener.</p>

<p>The Popo or Popotea (<i>Orthonyx albicilla</i>) is a
little brown bird with a white head, which sings like
a chaffinch, and principally lives about rata trees.
We see them not infrequently.</p>

<p>The Riroriro (<i>Gerygone flaviventris</i>) is a little
warbler seen about in company with the tauhau.</p>

<p>The Toutou (<i>Miro longipes</i>) is a small grey and
white bird, which some people have said is called
the New Zealand robin. It is to be seen in the
bush now and then, and seems tame, but <i>we</i> prefer
to call another species <i>our</i> robin.</p>

<p>The Pihoi (<i>Anthus N.Z.</i>) is the so-called native
"lark." It is a ground pipit, and may often be seen
fluttering and chirping about a bush road.</p>

<p>The Korohea (<i>Turnagra Hectori</i>) is the native
thrush, and a poor imitation it is of the English
throstle. It is scarce. Sometimes its song may be
listened to with pleasure.</p>

<p>The Kokako (<i>Glaucopis Wilsoni</i>) is a crow, and
is not uncommon in the Kaipara. It has blue
wattles on the beak. Its note is peculiar, being
sometimes a low, hollow boom, and at others a
shrill and somewhat bell-like tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>The Putoto (<i>Ortygometra Tabuensis</i>) is a crake,
often confounded by settlers with the patatai. It is
a smaller bird altogether, having partridge tints on
the back, and a grey breast. It chiefly inhabits
raupo swamps.</p>

<p>The Torea, or oyster-catcher (<i>Haematopus
longirostris</i>) is one of the sea-coast birds, and is
often to be seen about our tidal rivers. It is a
black bird.</p>

<p>The Kotuku, or crane (<i>Ardea syrmatophora</i>),
must just be mentioned, though none of us ever saw
one. But the Maori have a proverb&mdash;"as rare as
the kotuku."</p>

<p>There are various species of duck indigenous to
the country, and seen in great flocks on the rivers.
Some of them have really fine plumage, and others
are dull in colour. We shoot and eat them all
indiscriminately, and consider them very good.
The species we have identified in the Kaipara and
Hokianga are&mdash;the Putangi, or "paradise-duck"
(<i>Casarca variegata</i>); the grey duck, or Parera (<i>Anas
superciliosa</i>); the brown duck, an allied species or
variety of the last; the Papanga, or "teal," or
"widgeon" (<i>Fuligula N.Z.</i>), and some other varieties
that may be imported birds, or crosses, or other
native species. Besides these are numerous species
of seabirds: gulls, albatross, tern, skua, penguin, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
We never eat them, of course, though the Maori do,
as they occasionally shoot some for the sake of their
feathers.</p>

<p>The Tauhau (<i>Zosterops lateralis</i>) is a beautiful
little green bird, much like a wren. It has a gold
or silvery ring round the eye. It is much seen about
gardens and clearings, and settlers know it as the
"blight-bird." It frequents second-growth ti-tree,
where its little mossy nest and four or five pale
blue eggs may often be found. This bird is said
to have only recently come to the country, from
no one knows where. It is quite at home now,
and we see its nest oftener than that of any other
species.</p>

<p>The Waka-waka (<i>Rhipidura flabellifera</i>) is <i>the</i>
robin of our Brighter Britain. It is a fantail, or
flycatcher. It has dark brown tints pied with white
and black. When one is working or travelling in
the bush, a pair of these dear little birds will stay
with one all day. They appear beside you in the
morning, and remain with you till night. They
flutter and flirt about you, sitting on twigs and
regarding you with a bright beady eye, whilst
chirruping in a soft, unobtrusive undertone. We
find their nests sometimes, in bush-lawyer or supple-jack
clumps, or in birch-trees, They are curiously
built with spiders' webs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>Many a rough, rude bushman has grown quite
sentimental regarding these little companions of
man, and would visit with dire vengeance any
attempt to harm them. The Maori, as usual, have
quaint superstitious fancies about them. An old
fellow, who in youth had been "out" with Hone
Heke, was once my companion on a journey through
the forest. He alluded feelingly to the waka-waka
that, as usual, were fluttering about us.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, "they are little spirits" (atua
nuke-nuke). "They come to see what men are doing
in the bush by day, and go back to tell God at night.
To-night they will say, 'we saw the Maori and the
Pakeha together in the forest. They ate of the
same, and drank of the same, and slept together in
one blanket, and were brothers.' And God will
say, 'It is good!'"</p>

<p>These are the birds known to the naturalists of
our shanty, but there are plenty more species, rarer,
or whose habitat is limited to districts south of this.
And now, too, any ornithological catalogue of the
country must contain the names of numerous acclimatised
species, many of which are getting almost
too abundant. We have many English song-birds
and insect-eaters; larks and linnets and thrushes,
etc. And we have game in any quantity in some
districts, rapidly extending all over the islands, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the following descriptions: The English pheasant
(<i>Phasianus colchicus</i>), the Chinese pheasant (<i>Phasianus
torquatus</i>), the partridge (<i>Perdix cinerea</i>), the
Californian quail (<i>Ortyx Californicus</i>), the Australian
quail (<i>Coturnix pectoralis</i>), and some others.</p>

<p>I have already said something about insects,
when describing our home life. I spoke of the
mosquito (<i>Culex</i>), of the sandfly (<i>Simulium</i>), and of
the kauri-bug (<i>Polyzosteria N.Z.</i>). I think I also
mentioned a certain not wholly unknown and <i>nimble</i>
creature, which the Maori are accustomed to term
Pakeha-nuke-nuke, or "little stranger."</p>

<p>Then there is the Cricket (<i>Cicada</i>), which swarms
on the clearings, eating down the grass, and doing
damage in the gardens and fields. It is the chief
enemy of farmers. We have to keep large flocks
of turkeys on the clearings to keep down the
crickets. They devour the insect greedily, getting
to a marvellous size on the food, and acquiring a
delicacy and flavour far beyond that of stubble-fed
birds. A plague of caterpillars also appears sometimes,
which must be combated by similar means.</p>

<p>We have flies in hosts, innumerable spiders,
some of them as big as walnuts, with hairy legs like
a crab's claws, huge flying locust-grasshoppers, goat-chafers,
cock-chafers, dragon-flies, beetles, and butterflies,
the last not often remarkable for size or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
brilliance. There are two unique creatures that
must have special reference made to them.</p>

<p>The Hotete is the so-called "vegetating caterpillar."
It is a grub two or three inches long, and
out of its head there grows a parasitic fungus
(<i>Sphaeria Robertsii</i>), in the form of a long spire or
blade, six or seven inches in length, with a seed-spur
on the top. The natives eat the hotete. It is the
larva of <i>Hepialus virescens</i>, a kind of locust.</p>

<p>The Weta (<i>Deinacrida heteracantha</i>) is a
creature of the locust form living in dead-wood.
Its body may reach to three inches in length, and
be about the thickness of one's thumb. It is
covered with horny scales, resembling those of a
shrimp, but of a darker brown colour. The head
is perfectly black, and resembles a small lobster,
with the claws and mandibles projecting downwards.
There are two large staring eyes, and two immense
antennæ. It has six legs, the latter pair being very
strong and large, while all are armed with serrated
edges or files, and with hooked claws. Behind,
there is a horny, wedge-like spine. From the hinder
claws to the tip of the antennæ the weta may
measure sixteen inches, if a full-grown specimen.
It bores its way through dead-wood, in which it lives.
Sometimes you get a weta on your clothes, and feel
horrified; but it is perfectly harmless, though you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
will have to take it in pieces to get it off you. The
larva of this reptile, a huge sickly-white maggot, is
a great prize to a Maori. He fixes it on a stick,
toasts it at the fire, and eats it with every sign and
expression of extravagant delight. I must say that
the odour of the toasted grub is very appetizing,
still, I never could bring myself to try one.</p>

<p>The poisonous spider of Taranaki&mdash;if, indeed, it
really exists&mdash;is unknown in our part of the country.
We have numbers of bees. Nearly every hollow
tree contains comb. The shanty is seldom without
a bucketful of honey, for the consumption of those
who like it. These bees are a naturalized importation
though; there were none indigenous, I understand.</p>

<p>When touching on the Maori commissariat I
alluded to our fish. We have, indeed, a wealth of
fish in all the tidal waters. Sharks, schnapper, rock-cod,
mackerel, mullet, herring, sole, halibut, albacore,
barracouta, king-fish, and others. All sorts of ways
of fishing may be practised successfully. One can
always get fresh fish for supper, for half an hour's
trouble; and a day or night's netting or spearing
will provide ample store for smoking, drying, or
salting. There are eight kinds of whales, so bay-whaling
is carried on round the coast. There are
also seals and dolphins.</p>

<p>The Maori think most of shark-meat, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
they cure largely. It is stinking stuff. We are
always ready to lend a hand at a shark-hunt, which
is good sport, but we decline our share of the
plunder. We prefer the substantial schnapper, the
goodly whapuka or kanae, or the luscious porahi.</p>

<p>Cockles, mussels, clams, mutton-fish, oysters, and
other molluscs abound in the mud and on the rocks.
In the freshwater streams are eels, lampreys, and
whitebait; and now salmon and trout have been
introduced into many of them, and are doing well.
People who admire a fish diet should come here.
They could revel in profusion of it, as the Maori
did and do.</p>

<p>When the naturalist's note-book of our shanty
shall have become enlarged and more copious, I
may possibly be able to add to this slight sketch
of the natural history of Northern New Zealand.
But perhaps I have already said more than enough
to weary the hapless reader.</p>

<small>THE DEMON DOG&mdash;A YARN.</small></h2>


<p>Old Colonial is good at spinning yarns, and there
is one of his I should like to put in here, because
it is so thoroughly descriptive of the very first essays
at pioneer-farming in this district.</p>

<p>One night, when we were all comfortably settled
to our pipes round the fire in our shanty, by general
request, Old Colonial began as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! it's a good many years since I first came
up into this district, new as it is even yet. Near
as Auckland is, comparatively, the people there
know no more about us than the folks at home.
I've stuck close to the district, as I like it, and think
it's as good as any in the colony. But, you see,
other people don't. New-chums, if they hear of the
Kaipara at all, learn that it's very hilly, and all bush
of one kind or another, and that frightens them; so
they go south to the open districts. And then,
Government is more interested in getting settlers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
elsewhere than here. People are told that there
are no roads up here, and that the Maori hold the
greater part of the land. That is enough for them,
of course, and they don't come up to see for themselves.
As there is no decent map of the colony
available as yet, naturally they cannot know that
what with our tidal rivers and freshwater creeks,
intersecting the district in all directions as they do,
we really want no roads, as no one will settle in the
back country until the water frontage is filled up,
which will not be for many years yet. Then, our
Maoris are the best neighbours any one could wish
to live among, and are only too well pleased to sell
lands and welcome new settlers.</p>

<p>"After all, we are just a trifle out of the way,
you must allow. Although we've got Tom's little
steamer now, running regularly on the rivers, still,
communication with the city means two transhipments
and a portage, with tremendously heavy
freights, unless you can charter a cutter yourself and
go all round by the open sea. So that, though we
settlers may think the Kaipara in every way desirable,
there's good reason for those who have
never been in it to give their preference to the
Waikato, or Wanganui, or Canterbury.</p>

<p>"However, I dare say you are beginning to wonder
what all this has to do with my tale of old times.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Not being a professional story-teller, I suppose I'm
not over good at shaping a yarn, especially at the
beginning, but&mdash;there's some more rum in that
bottle!&mdash;if you'll have patience I shall get into the
thick of it directly.</p>

<p>"Well, the district being what it is in this year
of grace eighteen hundred and seventy, you may
easily suppose that, sixteen years ago, it was quite
like coming into an undiscovered world to come
up here. At that time I believe that Karl was
really the only settler in the entire tract of country;
and as that comprises between two and three
thousand square miles, and as there were no more
Maoris then than there are now, probably not more
than a total of a thousand altogether in all the little
kainga round, it could scarcely be called a populous
part of New Zealand.</p>

<p>"I don't know what had tempted Karl to select
up this way. Probably accident led him into the
Kaipara, and when here he saw his way to something.
There is no doubt that if things had gone
straight he might now have been one of the richest
men in the province. However, things did not go
straight, and why they didn't is the subject of my
tale.</p>

<p>"I first happened upon Karl in Auckland, sixteen
years ago it is now, as I have just told you. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
was a German by race, but English by education,
and seemed to have knocked about the world a
good bit. He was a tall, powerful man, quiet and
composed in general demeanour, rather pleasant to
get on with, well-informed and gentlemanly, but
with a decidedly rough and wild side to his character,
which only appeared now and then. I agreed to
hire with him for a spell, and accompanied him on
his return to this district.</p>

<p>"A year or so previously Karl had purchased
Hapuakohe on the Arapaoa river&mdash;that is the place
we went to help with the cattle at the other day,
and the best farm in the district it is now. Karl
had got about six thousand acres dirt cheap, as
land goes to-day, and had settled on it at once.
Being the first purchaser from the tribe, the Maoris
of the district held him in high esteem, and a lot of
the young men gave him their labour at the start,
as part of the bargain. They helped him to get
timber and build a shanty and sheds, to enclose
a bit of ground for potatoes, and so on, and to put
up a stockyard. Then Karl chartered a small vessel
from the Manukau, and brought up his various
necessaries&mdash;a few head of cattle, some pigs, fowls,
a dog or two, and so forth.</p>

<p>"Of course he was going to commence with
running cattle in the bush, as we do at present, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
a happy chance saved him from the necessity of
this, and all its attendant hard work. Some part
of his place had been in Maori occupation comparatively
recently, and was only covered with fern and
ti-tree bush. The season was a very dry one, unusually
so, and Karl was able to burn off all this
stuff tolerably clean. He still had some capital left,
and with that was able to buy grass seed, though at
a ruinous price in those times, and sow down his
burns. By this means he got something like a
thousand acres of pasture after the rains came&mdash;a
thundering good lift, you will say, for a settler in
his second year only.</p>

<p>"But Karl's grass was not to be compared with
what we get on our clearings. In the first place,
the land was poor, and the seed did not take so
well; then, he had sown rather scantily, so that a
good deal of fern and flax and ti-tree came up with
the young grass, and made it patchy and poor.
Still, it was a great thing for these parts, where there
is no native grass, for it enabled Karl to run sheep
at once.</p>

<p>"Of course the grass was not all in one piece.
It ran in and out among the standing bush, occupying
the lower levels of ranges and the rising grounds
at the bottom of gullies, spreading altogether over
a good stretch of country. Karl got up sheep to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
stock it, but his capital was exhausted; and he ran
into debt both for the sheep themselves, and with
the shipper who brought them up. Not that this
seemed of much consequence, for a year or two's
increase of wool and lambs would pay off the debt
and leave something in hand. But the Maori help he
had didn't last very long; and as his creditors, being
poor men, pressed him a good deal, Karl had to
come into Auckland and raise money on mortgage.</p>

<p>"Land was low enough in value all over the
colony, at that time, and a block up this way was
not thought much of, you may be sure, so that Karl
only got enough, by mortgaging his whole six
thousand acres, to pay off his two creditors and
leave him a very small balance. Well, the prospect
was good enough, as any one but a new-chum can
see, but all hung upon the sheep. There did not
seem a great risk, but still there always is a certain
amount of that with sheep. Disease did not trouble
Karl much; there need be no great fear on that
account in this country, if a little care be taken.
Drought, too, was no matter for anxiety, as the land
was sufficiently well-watered. But it was out of the
question to fence in the grass, so we had to take what
chance there was of the sheep straying, or of the
damage wild pigs might do to the young turf, or of
dingoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! you may laugh, but dingoes were what we
feared most then. It has been proved by this time
that if ever dingoes or runaway curs did exist, they
are practically a myth, as far as this part of the island
is concerned. Still, that was not so sure in those
days, and the suspicion that they were in the bush
was always a source of trouble to sheep farmers.
The pigs' ravages we could check by a thorough
hunt once or twice a year; and there was not much
to fear from the sheep's straying, as, except one or
two particular breeds, they will not go far into the
bush or away from the grass. But the wild dogs
were a different matter, if they came, and no one
could be quite sure that any night might not find
them among the flock.</p>

<p>"Such was the position of affairs when I came to
live with Karl. Stop! I am forgetting one circumstance,
the most important, in fact; for, if it had not
been for her, I don't believe Karl would have cared
so much about his farm. He was just the sort of
man who is perfectly indifferent to ruin if it comes,
so far as he himself is concerned; but she made his
views of the future entirely of another colour.</p>

<p>"When loitering about Auckland, while he was
getting his mortgage arranged, Karl got introduced
to one or two families. He was not what you would
term a society man, but, for all that, he managed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
make up to a certain young lady he met. They fell
in love with one another and got engaged, with all
the usual rapidity of such affairs out here. There
was even some talk of an immediate marriage, but
the lady's father would not hear of that when he
came to know Karl's position. He did not oppose
the match in any way, but only stipulated for its
postponement until Karl should have paid off his
mortgage, and built a house more suitable for a
family man than his then existing shanty. So Karl,
inflamed with as violent a passion as I ever saw in
any man, had to wait, three years as he calculated,
until he was in a really proper condition to marry.
This was a tremendous incentive to him to go ahead
with vigour.</p>

<p>"When Karl returned to the bush I came with
him, and took up my residence as one of the party at
Hapuakohe. Besides myself Karl had one other
chum, and there were two Maori boys who were
generally on the farm, and who gave a good deal of
labour in exchange for somewhat indefinite wages.
They were yet unsophisticated in those days, and
were not so fully aware of the pecuniary value of
their own labour and time as they are now. Of
course our work was hard and continuous. Looking
after the sheep, especially at lambing time, and
shearing them when the season came round, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
principal item. Then there was occasionally some
job or other with the little herd: half a dozen cows,
a bull, and a few young beasts, who roamed over
bush and grass as they pleased, and had to be got
up sometimes, or some trifling dairy work done.
Then there were the usual garden crops, and the
pigs to be seen to. Besides this, one of us had to
row and sail the whole fifty miles down to Helensville
every now and then, since there was no nearer
place then where we could have obtained our stores.</p>

<p>"Nearly six months of the year we were hard at
work falling bush and making new grassed clearings.
We made no attempt at fencing, for Karl considered
that the acquisition of more grass for his rapidly
increasing flock was of paramount importance.
Getting material, and fencing the Hapuakohe grass
in, would indeed have been a stupendous task for
our three pairs of hands to undertake, owing to the
straggling character of the cleared land, and the
consequent extent of the lines of fence required;
moreover, there was no real necessity for it on a
mere sheep-walk. The sheep would not stray very
much, and, as Karl said, the only other reason was
the dingoes, and no fence we could construct would
have kept them out. But Karl had made great inquiries
in Auckland, and from the natives, about these
alleged wild dogs. He had not only been unable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
find any one who had ever seen one, but even any
one who knew any other person that had. So we
almost succeeded in banishing the thought of them
from our minds.</p>

<p>"Thus a couple of years passed away, and Karl's
wool sales enabled him to bank a small instalment
towards paying off his mortgage. However, it was
evident that more than another year must elapse
before he was in a position to marry, for the wages
paid to the other man and I, together with current
expenses, cost of more grass seed, and so forth, ate
into the realized sum very deeply. On the other
hand, the large annual increase of the flock would
make the returns of each succeeding year very much
greater. But I must tell you of our other chum,
since it was about this time that Karl killed him.</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought that would startle you and fix
your attention. Yes, there's a murder in my tale,
coming presently. Listen!</p>

<p>"Brail, his name was; the only name I ever
knew him by. He was a short, thickset man, a
beggar to work, no matter what he was at. He
professed to be English, but there was evidently
some foreign blood in him, for his skin was darker
than ours. His black bristling beard came up nearly
to his eyes, and gave him a formidably ferocious
look. He was reserved and silent, though civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
enough to me in a general way. I gathered little
by little, and at various times, that there was a bond
of old standing between Karl and this man. Though
he was a paid labourer, just as I was myself, yet it
seemed that they had known one another for years.
It could hardly be friendship as that is ordinarily
understood; for Brail was a disagreeable companion
at the best of times, and he and Karl were for ever
snapping and snarling at each other. I concluded
that the latent savagery which was in each, though
differently manifested, formed a sort of tie between
them.</p>

<p>"This Brail had a sullen hang-dog expression,
and, at times, a fierce gleam in his scowling eyes that
I did not like. Neither did Tama-te-Whiti, the old
Maori chief, who was my very good friend in those
days, as he has ever remained since. Tama used to
visit Hapuakohe sometimes, and I well recollect his
aversion for Brail. After speaking with him,
Tama would often turn to me with an expression of
profound contempt, and hiss out, 'kakino tangata!'
I never really knew anything of the former relations
of Karl and this man. I formed a theory from various
little things that reached me, which may be true or
may not. I imagine that Brail had been a convict,
possibly a runaway and bushranger in Australia;
that Karl, induced by some old-time regard for him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
had aided him to escape to New Zealand, and had
found him an asylum with himself. Something like
this seems probable.</p>

<p>"Brail possessed a dog, which I must specially
mention. It was one of those big yellow, shaggy-haired
curs that are of the original Maori breed.
This beast was trained into a very fair sheep-dog,
and did its work along with the colleys belonging
to the farm. It was the one thing upon earth
that Brail seemed really to love, but even in this he
showed his half-barbarous nature; for he would
sometimes beat and kick the poor cur in the most
brutal way, and again would caress and fondle it like
a child. Whatever he did to it the dog never left
him. It could scarcely be called obedient, but night
or day, waking or sleeping, it never left its master.
The animal was intelligent enough, and had that
curious likeness to Brail that one may notice a dog
often gets for its master. But he prided himself that
the dog had some tincture of human nature in it.
He had bought it, when a year old, from a Maori
woman, at the price of two plugs of tobacco; and it
seems that this woman had suckled the whelp herself,
in its early infancy, having lost a new-born child of
her own. You know that this peculiar custom of giving
suck to young puppies is not an uncommon thing
among Maori women. Brail's dog, as you will see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
by-and-by, had certainly acquired some super-canine
qualities, but whether from its human foster-mother
or from the teachings of its master, I cannot tell.</p>

<p>"Karl was indifferent to the beast. He was a
hard man, and a rough one with all animals. He
had no love or tenderness for them; nor did they
show attachment to him. His own dogs obeyed
him as their master, but did not love him as their
friend. He cherished his sheep, looking on them as
valuable property, without any feeling for them as
living things. It is a character common in the bush.
And this made a frequent cause for squabbles between
him and Brail. Not that Brail cared for animals a
bit more than Karl did, in a general way; only for
that yellow dog of his. Though he often ill-treated
it himself, it made him savage to see any one else do
so; and Karl rarely came near it without a kick or a
blow, more to tease Brail, I think, than for any other
reason.</p>

<p>"All this time Karl used to make excursions
down to Auckland as often as he could, to see his
lady-love. He was getting more and more hopeful
about his prospects; and would frequently talk about
them to me, and about her also. But he never
spoke on these topics before Brail; and I could see
that he began to have thoughts of getting rid of the
coarse, ill-mannered, foul-tongued ruffian, before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
brought his bride up to the place. As it was, Brail
rarely left the run. When he did go down to
Helensville, or across to Whangarei, he invariably
indulged in heavy drinking at the stores. He would
fight and brawl with any sawyers or gum-diggers
that might be hanging about; so that 'Karl's black
devil of a chum' was no welcome sight at either settlement.
And Karl was becoming more fastidious, as
intercourse with his betrothed refined and softened
his character.</p>

<p>"One day Karl, in entering the shanty, stumbled
over the great carcase of the yellow dog, as it lay
stretched out upon the floor. He kicked it savagely,
and the brute turned and snapped at his leg; though
his tall boots prevented the bite from doing him any
harm. However, Karl, being enraged, seized an
axe or something that was standing near and made
a blow at the cur. But Brail rushed forward and
seized his arm, and with one of his usual oaths
growled out&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Can't you leave that dog alone? I tell you
there'll be a row one of these times!'</p>

<p>"The two glared at one another silently for a
moment, and then Karl, still heated, threw down the
axe and, laughing lightly, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Oh no, there won't; because I'm going to give
up both you and the cur!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"'What?' cried Brail, and his teeth set, while
an ashen pallor overspread his face, and his eyes
seemed drawn in under his heavy lowering brows.</p>

<p>"Karl looked at him, and then seemed vexed, as
though he had said something more than he intended.</p>

<p>"'There,' he said hastily, 'don't put yourself
out. I merely meant that you'd better look for work
somewhere else soon, as I intend altering things
a bit.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, that's all, is it?' returned Brail, looking
relieved. 'It's well it is all you meant, you know!'
and with that he went out. Karl followed him, and
some more passed between them that I did not
catch. But there was a wicked look about Brail
that I did not admire.</p>

<p>"Nothing further came of the incident; both men
seemed to have forgotten it when next they met.
Only a day or two after, as we were working together,
Brail addressed a series of rather curious remarks
to me. It never struck me at the time, but afterwards
I thought he must have been trying to find
out whether Karl had told me anything of his&mdash;Brail's&mdash;past
history. I did not know anything of
it then, and so Brail seemed satisfied.</p>

<p>"It was a custom of ours for one or two to camp
out sometimes, when working on a distant part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
the farm, so as to save two or three miles tramp
backwards and forwards every morning and evening.
So, after this, Brail built himself a hut in a little gully
some three miles distant from the shanty. There
were some lambing ewes lying on the grass in that
direction, and Brail had to watch these, while falling
bush on one side of the gully at the same time.
So he moved up to his hut, carrying his necessaries
along with him, and accompanied by his dog.</p>

<p>"Perhaps a fortnight after Brail had been camping
up there, I was milking some of the cows near the
shanty towards evening. While so occupied, I
heard Karl's coo-ee from the direction of Brail's
camp, where I knew he had gone. I answered, and
presently the signal&mdash;three short quick coo-ees&mdash;informed
me I had to go to him at once. I coo-ee'd
the answer that I was coming, finished my milking,
took the cans into the shanty, and set out. I ran
up along the range, and had got more than half-way
towards Brail's clearing before I saw anything of
Karl. I was in an ill temper at having to go so
far, being tired with the day's work, and so it never
struck me that anything might be wrong.</p>

<p>"Presently I saw Karl sitting on a log, and as
I made towards him, he rose and walked to me. I
noticed there was blood on his shirt and pants, but
that simply made me conclude that he had killed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
sheep, and that I was summoned to help carry the
mutton home before the flies could get to it. I
merely said crossly&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Well, where is it?'</p>

<p>"Karl pointed towards Brail's camp without
speaking, and we both walked on. Presently he
spoke, in such hoarse, shaky tones, that I turned
and looked closely at him. There was trouble and
distress in his face of an unusual sort.</p>

<p>"'Old man,' he said, 'you'll stand by me, won't
you?'</p>

<p>"'Of course,' I answered.</p>

<p>"'Are Wi and Tara back?' he asked then,
meaning our two Maori boys, who had been away
at their own village for several days. I replied in
the negative, whereat he responded with a fervent
'Thank God!'</p>

<p>"'What's up?' I ejaculated in wonder.</p>

<p>"'I've killed Brail!' he whispered hoarsely.</p>

<p>"'Good God!' I cried. 'What do you mean,
Karl?' and I sat down involuntarily; for the announcement
came almost like a blow. He stood
beside me, evidently deeply agitated.</p>

<p>"'Look here, old man! You're a true chum,
I know. You'll keep this matter dark, for my sake&mdash;for
<i>her</i> sake, rather. See here, I swear to you it
was justifiable&mdash;nay, it was accident!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>"I simply nodded. He went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I went down to where he was at work without
a thought of this; that I swear before Almighty
God. Then that beast of his, that damned dog,
flew at me. I raised my axe to strike at it. He
came forward with that fierce rage on him that you
may have noticed sometimes. I heard him grind
his teeth and hiss between them, "You will have
it then; you! the only man who knows my secret,
b&mdash;&mdash; you!" And then he rushed at me with his
knife in hand. I hardly know how it happened.
I struck at him with the axe, meaning to knock the
knife out of his hand. That was all I had in my
mind, I take God as my witness&mdash;it was all. But
somehow, I know not how, the axe caught him on
the head. It was sharp, it was heavy; it cut through
the bone as through the rind of a gourd. He fell&mdash;dead!'</p>

<p>"Karl spoke in hoarse, hurried, spasmodic tones.
He wrung my hand in his, and looked beseechingly
into my eyes.</p>

<p>"'Old man, you and I can share this&mdash;secret!
You know me; you know I would not lie to you,
not even for my life. You can believe the truth
as I have told it you.'</p>

<p>"I waved his hand away, then took and wrung
it hard. There was no need for more. I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the man, I knew what he wanted of me. I understood
at once. It was not fear for himself, it was
for her, his wife that was to be. He had little
cause to fear, indeed, for, with such evidence as I
must perforce have given, no jury would have
convicted him of more than manslaughter. But,
why make the matter public at all? No one knew
of it, except us two. No one need know of it. The
shock of such a thing would be terrible for the
innocent girl he hoped to marry. It might, probably
would, break off the match.</p>

<p>"All this flashed across my mind. I had been
in wild, lawless countries; I had seen many a
violent death; it was no new and terrible thing to
me. Boys! what would you have done? I liked
Karl; I loved him, I think. We were friends;
and the dead man I had detested. I believed every
word he had said, as I believe it still. What need
for more? Should I be the one to destroy all his
future hopes, just for the sake of blurting about this
miserable affair, to serve no particular end that I
could see? No!</p>

<p>"I put my hands on poor Karl's shoulders, and
looked him steadily in the face.</p>

<p>"'Come,' I said, 'let us put this thing out of
sight, and&mdash;forget it.'</p>

<p>"He grasped my hands in his, while the tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
that welled from his eyes betrayed the depth and
extent of his feelings. Then we went to where the
body lay. I fetched a spade from the hut, and,
under the shadow of some stretching fern-trees, in
a secluded nook deep in the heart of a bit of bush
that neither axe nor fire was ever likely to touch,
we dug Brail's grave.</p>

<p>"We scarcely spoke at all. There was no need
for words, for each of us understood the other so
well. When I stripped the body bare, preparatory
to laying it in its final resting-place, Karl simply
nodded. He knew, without my telling him, why
I did so. He comprehended that, in after time, if
those bones were ever laid bare, there would be no
vestiges of clothes or tell-tale buttons to give a clue
to the remains. It might be supposed, in such a
case, they were those of some slain warrior of
Ngatewhatua or Ngapuhi.</p>

<p>"And then we gathered together every fragment
of the dead man's property, and laid the things in
his hut, and heaped up dead wood and dry brush,
and set fire to the pile, and watched the bonfire
blaze to ashes. And we scattered the ashes in a
raupo swamp, and quietly went home.</p>

<p>"Anxious we were for some time after, but there
was little reason for us to be so. The Maoris
knew that Brail had intended leaving, and were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
surprised when we said he had gone. I myself had
conveyed a message from him to the storekeeper at
Helensville, stating that he was looking for another
job. What easier than to tell them there that he
had swagged it through the bush to the east coast
settlements? What simpler than to answer inquiries
for him in that direction, by saying he had gone
south? But no one ever cared to make close
inquiry after him. The few who knew him did not
like him. Poor wretch! ruffian as he was, I felt
some pity for him; he, lying buried in the bush,
friendless, unloved except by a dog as unlovable as
he had been himself.</p>

<p>"As regards that dog, Karl had told me he had
killed it, though he seemed somewhat confused
about the matter when I thought of it and questioned
him. He said that, after he had struck down Brail,
his mind was so overwhelmed with the sudden
horror of the affair, that he only faintly recollected
what followed immediately. He fancied the dog
attacked him; at any rate, he was sure he had
chopped at it or stabbed it with his knife, and he
distinctly remembered throwing its dead carcase to
one side. So the matter was dismissed, it being
merely a passing matter of surprise to me that I
had not noticed the dog's body at the time. Yet
I felt no call to go and look for it subsequently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"Months flew by, and the thought of the unlucky
affair was becoming less and less burdensome to us.
Shearing time had come and gone, and the Maoris
and one or two men from the settlements, who had
come up to help us with it, had departed. Karl
went down to Auckland in the cutter he had
chartered to transfer the season's wool there. It
would be the first time he had seen his betrothed
since Brail's death. Ever since then he had been
moody and depressed in spirits, melancholy and
unlike himself. But the soft feminine influence
had a vast soothing power over his mind, and he
returned to Hapuakohe cheerful and happy. Care
seemed no longer to weigh him down.</p>

<p>"Indeed, the prospect was brightening considerably
for him. Wool was up in price; and Karl had
not only paid the interest on his mortgage, but had
now a good sum in bank towards paying off the
principal. There were now between two and three
thousand sheep on his clearings, and, barring accidents,
another year ought to see him a free man
and able to marry. I, too, participated in the good
fortune that seemed to be with us, for I each year
took the bulk of my wages in sheep, continuing
them on the run with Karl's, on the usual system
of half gains half risk.</p>

<p>Karl was never weary of talking to me of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
future wife; about his love for her, and hers for
him; and we even ventured on castle-building by
the fireside of nights. The new house was planned,
its site fixed on, and the cost of it reckoned up.
All the free happy life that was to be we talked
over in pleasant anticipation. I was to get a place
of my own and marry, too. But there! You know
the sort of talk when times are good.</p>

<p>"One night we were sleeping as usual, in our
bunks on opposite sides of the shanty. The fire
was out, but the moon shone brightly through many
a chink and crevice in the walls and roof. Suddenly
I was awakened by a terrific scream from my chum.
Hastily throwing off my blanket, I leapt out of the
bunk and looked across at him. He was standing
in the centre of the floor, the sweat pouring from
his face and chest, his hair wet with it, his eyes
starting, and his whole form shaking so that he
could hardly keep erect.</p>

<p>"'Karl!' I cried, 'for Heaven's sake, what is it?'</p>

<p>"My voice seemed to bring him to himself, and,
after I had got him a drink of cold tea, he became
calmer, and was able to talk.</p>

<p>"'My God! I've had a fearful dream!' he said.</p>

<p>"'A nightmare, I suppose?' responded I.</p>

<p>"'I don't know,' he returned; 'it was something
more frightful than I ever experienced before. So
horribly real, too.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"After a while he continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I thought that Brail stood before me, just as
he did that day when I&mdash;when I&mdash;killed him. His
face had a detestably evil look, and he menaced me
with his hands. I seemed to hear him say, "My
vengeance is to come!" Then his form gradually
changed into that of his big yellow dog, with fangs
like a dragon's, and eyes that burnt horribly. It
seemed to take the shape of a devil's face, springing
at me out of hell, and I heard a confused sound of
"Blood for blood!" Then the horror of it forced
me to scream and awake.'</p>

<p>"Of course I affected to laugh at Karl's dream;
one always does that with the victims of nightmare,
I'm sure I don't know why, for there's nothing
laughable about such things when you come to
think of it. However, I discoursed in light fashion
about the effects of imagination, disordered stomachs,
and heavy suppers, though I saw all that I said had
no particular effect on his mind. By-and-by we
turned in again, and I slept till morning without
further disturbance.</p>

<p>"When morning came I found that the dream
still weighed heavily on Karl's spirits. He seemed
to be possessed of the idea that it 'meant something,'
though precisely what he could not say. He was
downhearted and anxious, and his thoughts naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
turned to the sheep. They meant so much to him,
poor fellow! He proposed that we should both
make a thorough tour of the run, and asked me to
catch a couple of horses that we might the better do
so. For we had a few 'scrubbers' about the place,
finding them necessary as economizing our time and
strength in getting about the extensive farm.</p>

<p>"We set off after breakfast, Karl riding along
the top of the range and I along the bottom, with
the dogs following us as of course. The first gully,
the same in which the shanty stood, had nothing to
show us. The sheep on the clearings in it were
feeding about as usual. But when we crossed over
the range, and came in view of the wide basin on
the other side, where was nearly five hundred acres
of grass, we were surprised to find no sheep at all
visible. We traversed it in all directions, sending
the dogs round all the standing bush, and then we
crossed the further range into a gully where a narrow
strip of pasture extended for some two miles. As
we came out of a piece of bush into this, we perceived
the sheep. They were not feeding about in
scattered groups, as was usual, but were collected in
one flock, huddled up together. Some were lying
down, panting, and all looked distressed and scared.
It was easy to see they had been driven, and that
quite recently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Karl galloped down the slope immediately, but
I reined in for a moment, looking to see if anything
was visible to account for this. Then a shout from
Karl made me hasten to join him. He had dismounted,
and was kneeling beside a ewe that lay
prostrate on the hill-side. As I came up he looked
at me with a terrible despair in his eyes, and, pointing
to the sheep, said quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"'That is what my dream meant. Look!'</p>

<p>"I jumped down and examined the ewe. It was
dead; and the mangled throat and torn wool plainly
told the cause.</p>

<p>"'Wild dogs!' I ejaculated with a bitter curse.</p>

<p>"We remounted and rode slowly about the
clearings, narrowly observing the condition of the
flocks. We found seven-and-thirty sheep dead or
dying, the work of the dog or dogs on the previous
night. A good many more were apparently injured
from the driving. We made every possible search
for the beasts that had done this, but not a trace of
them was discoverable.</p>

<p>"Karl seemed overwhelmed by the disaster. A
dark superstition seemed to have come over him,
and to its influence he despairingly succumbed.
Notwithstanding that, however, the innate courage
of the man impelled him, now and to the end, to
strive with every nerve against the evil fate that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
was pursuing him. Though he despaired from
the first, unnecessarily, as I thought, he was not
the sort of man to sit still with his hands in his
pockets. No, he would fight to the last. We
discussed what was possible to be done that day
as we surveyed the slaughtered sheep. Karl croaked
gloomily&mdash;</p>

<p>"'There is little use doing anything, however.
There is the hand of God, or of the devil, I know
not which, in this. It is a judgment on me&mdash;come
from Brail's grave. Through a dog I came to kill
him, by a dog his vengeance comes upon me!'</p>

<p>"'Bosh!' said I, 'you are letting that nightmare
of yours ferment in your mind. What we've got to
do is not to go fancying a pack of nursery tales, but
to set about exterminating these brutes before they
do more damage.'</p>

<p>"And then a thought struck me. I continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"'By the way, you're quite sure you killed that
yellow dog?'</p>

<p>"'Certain,' was his emphatic reply.</p>

<p>"I took occasion, as we were riding near the
place, to go and make a thorough search for the
skeleton of the dog. I could not find it, however,
though the thick undergrowth about there might
certainly have hidden it all the while. But this
satisfied me; I took up an unreasoning notion that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Brail's beast was the sheep-killer, though I could not
attempt to account for why it had never been seen
by us, if it were still living. I thought Karl might
easily have been mistaken in his agitation, in thinking
he had killed it; though why it should have
disappeared for nearly a year, and then suddenly
and mysteriously started on a career of crime, was
beyond me. Perhaps it had gone mad in solitude;
perhaps Brail's idea of its possessing half-human
attributes by right of its peculiar nurture, might
have something in it. The dog might have learnt
a species of rascally cunning from its master. I
did not know; I do not now. Doubtless these
thoughts did not all enter my mind at that time, but
have matured since. There is a weird and uncanny
feature in the whole thing that I cannot explain. I
simply relate the facts as I know them, without
trying to explain the unexplainable."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here, Old Colonial paused, and lit his pipe
meditatively. We, knowing his hatred of interruptions,
said nothing, and presently he took up the
thread of his yarn again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"So we drove the sheep that night upon the
clearings in the home gully, and kept watch over
them. But we knew we could not keep them there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
long, because of their number, and the scantiness of
the feed at that season. Next day, Karl proceeded
to lay poisoned meat about the run; while I rowed
up the river to Tama-te-Whiti's kainga. I told the
news to the Maoris, and Tama, with a score of his
men, accompanied me back to Hapuakohe.</p>

<p>"We feasted the Maoris that night upon the
slaughtered mutton, and held a great talk upon what
should be done. In the morning we sallied forth to
commence a systematic hunt through the surrounding
bush, the natives being delighted to engage in this,
especially as there was a prospect, unfortunately, of
unlimited fresh mutton. To our horror, we found
that the enemy had been at work again on the preceding
night, and many more sheep were killed and
crippled. This gave us a fresh impulse, and we
went at the hunt with a will. Separating into four
parties, under the respective leadership of Karl,
Tama, myself, and another Maori, we mapped out
the country before us to be carefully traversed.
Every piece of bush, every swamp and possible
shelter that lay in our way did we thoroughly beat.
The clearings were examined, the dead sheep looked
to, and every attempt was made to find traces of the
dingoes; but when night brought the day's work
to a close, we had all been entirely unsuccessful.
Not the smallest trace of the wild dogs had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
seen; only some of the bush-pigs had been found
and a few killed incidentally.</p>

<p>"It is needless for me to continue in detail. For
nearly a fortnight after, the same complete want of
success persevered with us. In vain we scoured the
bush far and wide by day, in vain we lay out watching
all night, in vain we had recourse to every
stratagem that our united cunning could devise. The
result was always the same. Nothing rewarded our
almost frantic efforts. And almost every night, under
our very noses so to speak, frightful ravages were
committed among the flocks.</p>

<p>"There was something so strange and uncommon
about these night attacks, something so weird in our
inability to obtain even a glimpse of the perpetrators,
that the superstitious fancies of the Maoris began to
come into play. I was getting nervous about Karl,
for he was gloomy and abstracted, as well he might
be, poor man! I alone knew he was imagining
things and regarding himself as the victim of a dead
man's vengeance. I knew that each fresh loss
among the sheep went to his heart like a knife, for
it seemed to divide him further from wedded happiness.
Despair appeared to weigh him down more
and more heavily. I began to fear for his reason.</p>

<p>"The intelligence of our misfortune was spreading
through the country. Our Maori friends had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
augmented in number, coming from Tanoa and
Matakohe and all round. The cordial kindness and
brotherhood of the bush rushed in sympathy towards
us. From Helensville came a boat-load of such
necessaries as it was thought we should stand most
in need of, with word to say that men would follow.
The rough bushmen on the Wairoa sent to say they
would come to our assistance if we needed them.
The generous settlers of Whangarei sent word that
they were coming in a body, to help us hunt down
the dingoes, or to put up fences and pens for us, that
Karl might pay for when he could, or not, it did not
matter.</p>

<p>"All this simple self-sacrificing kindness touched
us deeply, but it failed to rouse my poor chum's
spirits.</p>

<p>"'It is no use,' he murmured. 'I am doomed
to ruin. A third of the flock is gone already. The
rest will follow. <i>She</i> can never be mine now.'</p>

<p>"'Stuff!' I replied to him. 'Rouse yourself, man.
Do not despair yet. Come, we have work to do.
Let us first of all settle these damnation curs!'</p>

<p>"'I am with you there! I am with you there!'
he answered, his eyes glittering fiercely, as he rose
and grasped his gun.</p>

<p>"Then came a night I remember well. I lay with
Tama and some five or six Maoris in the bush on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the top of a range, that overlooked a wide stretch of
grass in the gullies on either side below us. The
night was balmy and moonlit, for it was near Christmas
time, and I was wearied, so I slept. Around us
in the distance sparkled the camp-fires of the other
watchers. Presently I was roused by Tama, who, in
an excited whisper, bade me listen. I peered forth
from the edge of the jungle, and could hear a low,
dull, rushing sound. I knew what that meant. It
was a large flock of sheep, running hard. In a
moment they came into view out of the shadows,
heading straight for where we crouched, plainly
visible in the flood of moonlight that streamed upon
the open side of the range. I could hear the quick
breathing of the Maoris beside me, as I leant forward
keenly intent upon the flock, my gun ready in my
hands. I watched the flock as it streamed rapidly
along the hill-side, and saw that here and there, in its
track behind, lay single sheep, crippled by stumps or
holes in the ground, or, as I knew by experience,
with mangled throats that spoke of the fangs of
murderous brutes. We waited and watched, the
moonlight gleaming on the barrels of our ready guns.
The flock passed close below us, tearing along in
the utmost extremity of panic. And our levelled
weapons were ready.</p>

<p>"As I am a sinful sinner, what I tell you is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
plain unvarnished truth. As the flock passed below
our eyes, we saw no beast of any kind but sheep.
No dog was visible there, that I could swear to.
And yet, close before us, a fine fat wether suddenly
leapt up and dropped, so near that we could see the
fresh blood spurting from a wound in its throat. I
rushed out upon the clearing and looked at it; I
looked after the vanishing flock and all around me,
but no sign of the destroyer could I see. A horrible
thrill passed all through me, for this was something
mysterious, unnatural, and unnerving. I could not
resist the sudden shivery feeling that crept over me
at this most unaccountable occurrence.</p>

<p>"And then, from close beside me, rose Tama's
shrill coo-ee. Louder and louder it rang out into
the still night, till answers came pealing from the
camps on the ranges around us. After a little we
saw the other watchers coming to us from their
various posts on the run, until presently all were
collected together, a silent wondering group&mdash;a
hundred Maoris, and Karl and I. Then Tama
spoke. What he said I do not know. It was some
vague relation of what we had seen, together with
frequent references to the 'tahipo'&mdash;devil&mdash;and
some 'kararehe tahipo'&mdash;demon dog. But the wild
excitement of the chief, the deadly terror that
possessed him, soon infected all the others. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
gathered round him in an eager cluster, and the
deep 'Ai,' and 'kuia' that broke from one and
another, testified their earnest attention and concurrence.</p>

<p>"Then they knelt down, there on the grass
around the dead wether. It was a curious group we
made in the moonlight on the hill-side, just beyond
the shadows of the bush. And Tama lifted up his
voice&mdash;literally so&mdash;and prayed. He prayed through
the Lord's Prayer, and the Creed, and through half
the questions and answers of the Catechism beside.
Being agitated, no doubt, he scarcely knew
exactly what he was saying. And then it seemed
to me, as well as I could follow the Maori, that he
indulged in an extempore delivery, half prayer, half
incantation, to meet the special requirements of the
case.</p>

<p>"When this performance, so grotesque yet so
simply serious, was over, these half-savage Christians
rose and began to take leave of us. They could
not stay to fight devils, they said; God and his
angels could alone do that, and they had prayed
that it might be so. Many blubbered as they shook
hands with us; they would have willingly fought for
us with anything of flesh and blood, but terror of
the unseen had now overmastered their sympathy.
They hurried away over the range and down to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
beach where their canoes lay, and so, flying from
haunted Hapuakohe, they left us two alone.</p>

<p>"All this could not fail to have its effect on one's
mind. I felt very uncomfortable, but Karl seemed
to take everything as though he had expected it.
When daylight came, and I was able to reason more
calmly about the mystery, I thought I saw a possible
solution. It was evident there could not be several
dogs, or we must have seen them, or traces of them.
Probably there was only one, for, great as was the
havoc that had been wrought, I did not think it
was impossible for a single ferocious beast to have
caused it. And then I reflected that a dog might
look so like a sheep in the moonlight, as not to be
readily detected among a flock. Why, I remembered
that a shaggy, grayish-yellow cur, such as Brail's
dog had been, for instance, was positively indistinguishable
amid a flock of sheep at night, especially
when the moon was shining. But the extraordinary
cunning and careful scheming that seemed apparent
in this case were, I confess, beyond my powers to
fathom; nor have I been able to account for them
to this day.</p>

<p>"We did what we could, we two, while we waited
for the promised help from the settlements. You
might think we could have shepherded the flock
near the shanty, and guarded them with our dogs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
but that we had found to be impossible. First,
grass was scarce there, and we had, of course, no
other feed to give them. Then, they had got so wild
with the constant chasing, that we must have been
continually worrying them with our own dogs, which
would only have made matters worse. There was
literally nothing to be done, but to watch for and
kill the dingo.</p>

<p>"Oh! it was a piteous sight to see the dead
sheep lying scattered about the clearings. And
among the survivors there were so many hurt that
must die, so many more that were injured so as to
be practically valueless; for the chasing on the
rough, stump-covered hill-sides had done more
damage than the actual fangs of the wild dog. I
was myself a sufferer, but my loss was as nothing
to poor Karl's. He, I saw, was ruined, if not
irretrievably, at least for some years to come. But
this made his marriage impossible now, unless the
lady's parents took a very different view of things.
Surely, I thought, the news must by this time have
got to Auckland. Perhaps the father had already
resolved to break off the match in consequence. I
was only a plain, simple bush-farmer, and it seemed
to me that if this girl were true in her love for Karl,
she would certainly leave her father and come to
him in his trouble. I thought I would myself write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
and tell her to do so, for, you see, I feared that he
would go melancholy mad for loss of her. But the
end of it was come."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Again Old Colonial paused, and gazed intently
into the fire, with a sad, grave expression shadowing
over his usually jolly, sunburnt face.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I left my camp one morning and strolled across
the run to the place where Karl had been watching.
He had selected the top of a steep bluff that jutted out
into the river and that, on the landward side, overlooked
a great extent of the run. As I climbed up
the range I shouted to him repeatedly, but, as there
was no answer, I concluded he was sleeping, and so
walked quietly on till I came out on the top. There
were the smouldering remains of his fire, the billy
in which he had boiled his tea, his blanket lying as
he had left it, but Karl himself was not there. I
shouted again and looked about me, and then something
made me start.</p>

<p>"It was his gun lying on the ground. I picked
it up, and saw that it had been discharged. There
was blood upon the stock, and stuck to the hammer
was a wisp of coarse yellow hair. Amazed, and
filled with a sudden cold sensation of fear, I examined
the ground about me. I saw grass and bushes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
trampled and broken as though there had been a
struggle on the spot. I saw splashes and blots of
blood here, there, and everywhere. And then
something prompted me to look over the cliff.
What I saw nearly caused me to fall, so horribly
did my heart leap in my throat. Down below there,
on the cruel rocks, head downwards on the beach,
lay his body. Dead he was, you could see that
from the top. Poor Karl!</p>

<p>"I rushed down through the gully on the left,
and made my way to where he lay. His head was
broken by the fall, but there were horrible wounds
besides upon his throat and limbs, gaping, torn, and
deep, too plainly the marks of some fierce beast's
teeth. And as I knelt beside the body, weeping,
stupified, agonized by the horror of the thing, a
fancy crept into my poor brains that I had been
a witness of that scene upon the bluff the night
before; when nought but the moon was there to
see, with the creek singing through the bush in the
gully, and the river-tide sweeping along below.</p>

<p>"I fancied I saw him sitting moody and despairing
by the fire. And up through the thick jungle
of the gully comes stealing the great yellow body of
that dreadful brute, that devilish cur that had first
ruined him and now meant to kill him. I saw it
spring upon him as he sat, with fangs gleaming and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
savage eyes of fire. I saw the flash of his gun, the
swinging blow, the curse of the man, and the growl
of the dog. I could fancy the ferocious joy upon
the face of the half-maddened man as he grappled
with his foe. I saw the hard, fierce struggle&mdash;glistening
teeth opposed to flashing steel. And then I
saw him conquer, but&mdash;only to seize the ponderous
brute, to hurl it from the cliff far into the river, and,
staggering, wounded to the death, overbalancing, to
fall headlong himself.</p>

<p>"I was roused from this dream by the trampling
of horses' feet. It was the men from Whangarei&mdash;kind,
cheery, sympathetic souls. They had ridden
all the way&mdash;all the fifty miles along the Maori track
through the forest. Poor as they were, they had put
aside their own concerns, and had come over to help
us in our trouble.</p>

<p>"But they were too late&mdash;too late! except to
help me lay my poor dead chum to rest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Ah! you guess now who the lady is that was
our hostess at Hapuakohe the other day. Karl
bequeathed to her, as a matter of course, all he had
to leave. But she knows only a small part of what
I have been telling you. There are portions of the
tale that neither she nor her husband know aught
of. You can guess what they are. Never hint at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
this story in their presence, or in that of their
children. I know I can rely on your silence.
Moreover, there is nothing to give rise to mention
of it, for no sheep-worrying wild-dogs, or dingoes,
have ever been heard of in the Kaipara since the
day that Karl died.</p>

<p>"When we were over there, I took the opportunity
of visiting the place where I laid him, long,
long ago, as it seems to me now. A thicket of
ferns hides all traces of the grave, and the wooden
cross that marked it has fallen and decayed among
them.</p>

<p>"What matter! He is at rest. And the kind
trees that shadow round him scatter the golden
kowhai bells and crimson pohutukawa blossoms
upon his mossy coverlet. The tide flows at his
feet, risping over the oyster-beds, swirling among
the mangroves, hurrying to the distant sea; just as
it did on that night so long ago, when it bore with
it away through the moonlit forest&mdash;away in secret
and unfathomable mystery&mdash;the accursed carcase of

<small>OUR LUCK.</small></h2>


<p>The sun has just risen, and brilliant gleams of light
are playing upon the waters of the Firth of Thames.
Above, in the air, rise the rugged summits of the
mountains, that golden range which stretches down
through Coromandel, from Cape Colville to Aroha,
a hundred and twenty miles of El Dorado. And
just before us, occupying a flat at the base of the
hills, is the gold-field centre, Grahamstown.</p>

<p>The steamer which has brought us from Auckland,
leaving late last night, is just drawing alongside
the little wharf at Shortland, having, for some
occult reason, passed by the long wooden pier that
runs out into the stream a little lower down, at
Grahamstown proper. She is loaded to the water's
edge with a human cargo. There is hardly standing
room aboard of her, though she is a fair-sized craft.
Men crowd every available part of her. Men of
all kinds&mdash;from the smooth-faced, sleek young clerk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
clean as to linen, gay as to dress, fresh from the
city atmosphere which has hitherto bounded his
experience, up to the hirsute, sun-browned, rough-looking
bushman, in jumper, moleskins, and ankle-jacks.
There are men of various nationalities, and
of every class, all eager, expectant, and excited,
huddled together promiscuously, and all have talked
through the whole weary night of but one subject&mdash;gold.</p>

<p>There is a "rush"; that is the explanation of the
crowded steamer, of other crowded steamers and
sailing-craft, that have come and will come, of men
on horseback and men on foot, who are converging
through the roadless country from all sides upon
the valley of the Thames. A day or two hence,
a new extension of the gold-field is to be proclaimed
and opened. Rumour says the prospectors have
struck a reef of unexampled richness; and almost
every one in Northern New Zealand is burning
with anxiety to be on the spot and take up a claim.</p>

<p>Our shanty has experienced the gold-fever,
mainly through the influence of O'Gaygun. Things
had not been very brisk with us of late, and so it
was determined to take a temporary spell of gold-mining.
All the community are partners in the
enterprize, but only four of us are actually going on
to the field. Old Colonial was not to be drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
away from the Pahi, and he, with some of the others,
remains to carry on the farm. O'Gaygun, the
Little'un, and the writer, are now landing from the
steamer, while Dandy Jack, who preceded us, is
already in Grahamstown.</p>

<p>You see, even gold-seeking requires some little
capital to start one at it. Here, the mining is all
in quartz, which necessitates it. There is no alluvial
washing to enable one to pan out one's dust, and
pay one's way with it from week to week. Now,
it happened that we had scarcely any ready money,
so we had to raise it. About a fortnight ago we
chartered a schooner in the Kaipara, loaded her
with fat steers, a few horses, some sheep, barrels of
pork, sacks of potatoes, and other produce, and sent
her off. She was to round the North Cape, and to
run for the Thames, and Dandy Jack went with
her. In anticipation of the coming rush, we reckoned
that he would be able to sell all the cargo at a good
figure, and have a tolerable sum in hand to carry us
on when we took up our claim. Subsequently, we
three others went down to Auckland, and took the
steamer thence.</p>

<p>The crowd, slowly disgorged on Shortland wharf,
turns to walk towards Grahamstown for the most
part. The two places are one town now, being
connected by a street about a mile long. Less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
ten years ago Shortland was the original and only
township, and then consisted of a single store, kept
by a half-breed. The land was all owned by natives,
and the stubborn old chief of the district, Te Moananui,
could not be prevailed on to part with territory
to the Pakeha.</p>

<p>Then came the discovery of gold; and at last
government got a strip of land from the Maoris.
It was opened as a gold-field on July 27, 1867.
Messrs. Hunt, Cobley, Clarkson, and White are
closely connected with the early history of the place.
They were the original prospectors, and struck it
rich. Though having scarcely money enough to
buy tools with at the start, they made a princely
fortune out of their claim.</p>

<p>Later, the Caledonian eclipsed even the enormous
success of Hunt's claim, yielding no less than ten
tons of gold during the first year. Some other
claims have done well, and more, of course, have
altogether failed. But the most money has been
made on the Stock Exchange. Each claim is necessarily
worked by a company, and some of its scrip
is got into the market. A share may one day not
be worth a five pound note, nay, has even been
given for a day's board at an hotel; a month later a
quarter of that share may change hands at £10,000.</p>

<p>This young town looks a good deal more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
its actual age. A good street runs right from Shortland
to Grahamstown, and though there are gaps
here and there, showing how close the untilled
wilderness is to the pavement, yet the shops, the
public buildings, the vehicles and foot-passengers, all
evidence a settled town life. There are some short
side-streets, neat houses and trim gardens; there
is quite a nucleus at the Grahamstown end, where
the principal batteries and crushing-mills are situated.
There are ten churches and five banks, besides
other public establishments in the place; for the
borough has a resident population of over five
thousand, and about as many more in the suburbs
of Tararu and Parawai, and in the district of the
gold-field generally. Such a rush as is now taking
place must also largely augment the population.</p>

<p>We make straight for the Governor Bowen
Hotel, for we are thoroughly ready for breakfast.
There we meet Dandy Jack, calm as ever amid the
stormy excitement that is raging all around, though
a feverish glitter in his eye shows that inwardly he
is as other men. He tells us that he has realized
the cargo, but has not done so well with it as we
had sanguinely expected. The Thames was better
supplied with provisions than we supposed. Nevertheless,
we have a fair sum in hand to make a start
with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>Dandy Jack has kept the horses; he says we
shall need them. It appears that the new field is
twenty miles or so from here, in a district called
Ohinemuri. The Warden is camped there, and
will proclaim the gold-field two days from now. Not
until that is done can any one take out the necessary
permit to dig for gold. And then there will be
a terrible race from the camp to the range where
the prospectors' claim is situated; for every one, of
course, will wish to peg out his claim as near as
possible to that reserved for the original discoverers.
It seems that every one is buying or stealing horses
for this exciting event; and Dandy Jack has refused
incredibly handsome offers, and kept the animals
he so luckily brought here in order that we may
have a chance of picking out a good claim.</p>

<p>It is settled among us that Dandy Jack and
O'Gaygun shall at once start for the Warden's
Camp. They will go by the native track through
the bush, and will ride, of course. The other two
horses they will lead, loading them with our tools
and swag. The Little'un and I remain at Grahamstown,
as we wish to see all we can of gold-mining
there. We shall reach the new field in time for the
reading of the proclamation, getting there by means
of a steamer, that is already plying briskly up and
down the river Thames.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>After seeing off the two cavaliers and their packhorses,
the Little'un and I begin roaming about
the settlement. By certain friendly offices we are
enabled to visit various claims, among which are
Hunt's, the Kuranui, the Caledonian, and the Golden
Crown, of course. We have here opportunity for
seeing all the methods employed for quarrying out
the auriferous rock, and we get much valuable information,
and many useful practical hints regarding
geological strata, the lay of the quartz, the character
and variations of gold-reefs, etc.</p>

<p>Then we visit the great pump, the principal
feature of interest in Grahamstown, as it is, perhaps,
the most stupendous enterprise in the colony as yet.
Water had proved a source of much trouble in the
Caledonian and other claims, which penetrated to
some depth. An association was therefore formed
for the erection of a pump. £50,000 was the cost
of its erection, and as much more is being spent in
sinking to lower levels.</p>

<p>The engine has a nominal force of 350 horse
power. The cylinder is eighty-two inches in
diameter, and the length of stroke ten feet. The
pump pipes are twenty-five inches diameter; and
the machine can raise ten tons of water per minute.
Its operation already extends to a depth of four
hundred feet below the sea-level. The output of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
the field, from 1867 to 1875, has been roughly estimated
to have been 1,080,202 ounces, valued at
£3,465,093.</p>

<p>The next objects of interest to us are the quartz-crushing
batteries. Of these we are told there are
thirty-six on the field. The smallest has four
stampers, and the largest sixty-two. Most of them
have between twenty and forty stampers.</p>

<p>We watch some of them at work; seeing the
mighty pestles thundering down upon the blocks
and fragments of stone, grinding them slowly into
powder. We see tons and tons of hard shining
quartz fed under the feet of the rows of stampers.
Then we see the sandy dust into which the rock
has been disintegrated, undergoing a washing to
separate from it the minute particles of gold. We
see it puddled up with water in great vats, and converted
into a thin mud. We see this liquid sent
over "beds," and "floors," and "ladders," and
"blanketings," and washed again and again. Finally
we see the gold that was in it collected as sediment
from the various washings. Yellow heaps of it are
piled in appointed places, waiting for removal.
Then comes the final process, the refining with
mercury and fire, and the casting of the gold into
ingots.</p>

<p>Not all the batteries or claims are being worked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
for many of their crews are either gone or going
to the new field. But this stoppage is merely
temporary. After the fresh excitement has subsided,
the men will come back to their work, finding
that £2 10<i>s.</i> or £3 a week of wages is better than
making nothing out of a claim of one's own.</p>

<p>So we see as much of the place as we can, even
climbing up the rugged ranges, and from their wild
summits looking down over the whole panorama of
the gold-field, with the waters of the firth beyond
it, and the bush-clothed heights upon the further
shore. And then we find a novel interest in the
<i>table d'hôtes</i> at the hotels, with the singularly mingled
company assembled at them. Everywhere is a feverish
excitement; everywhere every one can talk of nothing
but the new Ophir that is so soon to be opened.</p>

<p>We even indulge in a game or two of billiards,
a rare novelty and luxury to us bush-farmers of
the Kaipara. And we gaze with admiration and
reverence upon the well-displayed charms and attractions
of the barmaids in the saloons.</p>

<p>One of these ladies, more affable and less assuming
than her sisters, who are haughtily inflated
with the deep reverence and homage of thirsty
crowds of men, actually condescends to favour us
with a few words of conversation. We are gratified
and honoured beyond measure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>This most gracious lady informs us that the
proprietor of her bar is about to erect an hotel on
the new field, and that she is going up to tend bar
there. But it appears that the glorious profession
of which she is a member is not what it was. Certain
regulations that mine-owners have lately made, anent
the taking of "specimens" from the mines by the
paid miners, have almost destroyed a poor girl's
chances. She relates a legend about "the first barmaid"
who appeared at Grahamstown, her predecessor
at this very bar. That lady was the cynosure
and magnet for countless courtiers, of course, and
she would seem to have been a very practical
and square-headed young woman. Her many
admirers found that to gain a word, a look, a smile,
a ravishment of whatever kind, it was needful
to offer a frequent "specimen" for the lady's
acceptance.</p>

<p>"She was dashing, you know, but not a beauty
by any means," says our informant, with a toss of
her be-chignoned head. After a few months, she
sent a boxful of "specimens," the cherished donations
of her hundred slaves, to be crushed at one
of the batteries. They realized, so rumour hath it,
some ten or twelve thousand pounds. And the fair
one, satisfied with having blandished this pile out
of the Thames, and probably finding her oppor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>tunities
at an end, winged her triumphant flight
back to England.</p>

<p>The gorgeous and bedizened beauty who treats
us to this tale, hopes to do likewise at Ohinemuri.
Her attractions are greater than those of the lucky
princess she has been telling us about; or, no doubt,
she secretly considers that they are. She hopes to
see us at her new bar, and trusts we will remember
to bring her a "specimen" now and then. This
with a flash of black eyes, that makes the giant
Little'un shiver with emotion in his number fourteen
boots, and leaves us both helpless victims of the
siren.</p>

<p>The afternoon of the next day finds us on board
the river steamer, making our way to the spot
where, as we fondly hope, fortune lies waiting for
us. The steamer is cram full, of course, but the
voyage is not to be a long one. Although the
Thames river is navigable for nearly fifty miles,
up to the base of Aroha Mountain, we have not got
to go very far up it. Something under a score of
miles separates the new gold-field from Grahamstown.
Perhaps a dozen miles from the mouth of
the river we enter its tributary, the Ohinemuri
creek. The whole district around is known as the
Ohinemuri Plains, being a portion of the lower
valley of the Thames.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>Our experience of the Grahamstown neighbourhood
had led us to expect anything but a picturesque
country. We are agreeably disappointed. The
river winds through what are called plains here, but
the term is only relatively applied. The "plains"
are broken with spurs and undulations from the
higher ranges that bound them, and the country is
anything but one uniform level.</p>

<p>On either hand rise heavy mountainous ranges,
sometimes receding far into the distance, sometimes
approaching nearer to the river. Tracts of splendid
forest clothe the country, interspersed with bare
rock, open fern-land, low jungles of light scrub,
marsh, and fen. Forest and mountain form a background
to the broad valley through which winds the
(really) silver Thames, abounding with fish, its low
banks and firm sandy shores rich with a luxuriant
shrubbery. Further up, every mile adds to the
beauty of the scene around.</p>

<p>And all this great valley, containing a million
acres doubtless, is as Nature made it, unmarred by
the hand of man, save some little spots here and
there, where Maori kaingas are situated, and that
limited area which the gold-seeker now calls his
own. It is easy to see that this must eventually
become a magnificent expanse of farming tracts.</p>

<p>At present all this land is still owned by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
natives, a morose and sullen tribe. Great difficulty
was experienced in getting the Grahamstown field
out of their hands, and still more trouble has surrounded
the acquisition by Government of the new
extension. The chief, Te Hira, has been overruled
by his counsellors, and has reluctantly consented to
the sale of a portion of his territory. Already is he
disgusted with the advent of the Pakeha, and talks
of retiring with his chief adherents to some wilder
solitude. But his sister, Mere Kuru, who holds
equal dignity with himself, seems disposed to change
her ancient habits. She is said to be even welcoming
the new order of things, and is qualifying herself
to become a leader of modern Maori fashionable
society. She rules a large kainga, situated on the
Ohinemuri creek, about midway between Cashell's
and Paeroa, the two new landing-places for the
gold-field.</p>

<p>At the latter place we disembark, and proceed at
once to the Warden's camp, which is not far off.
It is a scene of glorious confusion. Round about
the tent of the official, with its flag, are grouped
sundry other tents, huts, wharès, breakwinds of
every conceivable kind, and of every possible
material. It is dark now, as evening has descended,
and the numerous camp-fires make a lurid light to
heighten the wildness of the scene. Crowds of men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
are grouped about them, eating, drinking, singing,
shouting, or talking noisily of the everlasting subject&mdash;gold.</p>

<p>Through the camp we pick our way, stumbling
over stumps and roots and boulders, splashing into
deep mud and mire, visiting every fire, and asking
for the whereabouts of our chums. We begin to
think we shall never find them amid the confusion
of the wild, disorderly camp, and have some thoughts
of applying for hospitality at the next fire. At
length one man, whom we have asked, replies to
our questions&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you mean a pretty sort of chap, looking
like a dancing-man or a barber, and a big, red-headed
Irisher with him for a mate? They're over
yonder, camped in Fern-tree Gully. Got some
horses with 'em, yes!"</p>

<p>We thought this evidently must refer to Dandy
Jack and O'Gaygun, so we stumbled down the little
dell, and found our surmise was right. We were
quickly welcomed, and supplied with supper.</p>

<p>Our friends had erected a rude breakwind of
poles and fern-fronds, sufficient to shelter our party
from the rain while we slept, should there be any.
A huge fire blazed in front of it; while not far off,
and well in view, the horses were tethered. They
were secured in far more than ordinary fashion, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
headstalls, and lariats, and hobbles. Dandy Jack
said there was momentary fear of their being stolen,
by miners anxious to use them on the momentous
morrow, and it was even thought necessary for one
of us to keep watch over them all night, which duty
we performed by turns. There was little fear of
anything else being plundered; indeed, next day we
left our swag exposed on the ground without anything
being taken. But horses meant odds in the
coming lottery, and the most honest men were
willing, just at that excited moment, to annex
temporarily the first they came across.</p>

<p>At length morning comes, bringing with it the
eventful day, the 3rd of March, 1875, which is to
see the opening of the new field. From earliest
dawn the camp is astir; and as the sun climbs the
sky, so does the intense hubbub increase. Oh, for
an artist's brush to delineate that scene! Pen and
ink are far too feeble.</p>

<p>Men move about like swarming bees, eagerly
talking and shouting with all and sundry. Groups
are gathered here and there, their eyes one minute
glancing anxiously towards the Warden's tent, the
next moment looking out across the wooded plain,
as it swims in the morning sunshine, towards the
towering ranges in the distance, where an abrupt
alteration in their outline shows the situation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Gorge, the spot where the prospectors' claim is
known to be, the goal of every hope to-day.</p>

<p>No one dares to leave his horse now for an
instant. Those that have any, like ourselves, for
the most part remain mounted, restlessly circling
about the camp. Every man that could beg, borrow,
or steal it, appears to have got a riding-beast of
some sort. A few are even bestriding bullocks,
judging, probably, that in the general scrimmage
and stampede, even those ungainly steeds will distance
men on foot.</p>

<p>We are all equipped with everything immediately
necessary, and are ready for the start. A tumultuous
assemblage it is that is now moving in a perfect
frenzy of excitement about the Warden's tent. A
concourse of men&mdash;rough men and gentle men,
blackguards and honest, young and old, ragged and
spruce, grave and gay, but all fevered to their
heart's core with the burning fury of the gold-digger.</p>

<p>Amid the throng there move a few Maoris from
the neighbouring kainga. Queer, old, tattooed
worthies, half-dressed in European rags, half draped
in frowzy blankets. These are stolid, disdainful.
They have come to see the Pakeha in their mad
state. And there are others, younger men, smiling
and chattering, evidently anxious to get excited, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
could they only understand what all the fuss is
about. There is a contemptuous air about them, a
kind of pity for the curious insanity that is rife
among the Pakeha about them.</p>

<p>And now the wished-for hour approaches. A
rude table is rigged up in front of the Warden's
tent, at which clerks take their places. Two or
three of the armed constabulary are visible, ostensibly
to keep order, which it would take more than
all the force to do. And a riotous throng of horsemen
and footmen wrestle and struggle for front
places near the table. Apparently, two or three
thousand men are waiting eagerly for the word to
start.</p>

<p>Then the Warden steps forth, looking grave and
dignified in his official coat and cap. He is the
only calm person present, and is received with
vociferous exclamation by the crowd. He holds in
his hand a roll of papers, which he proceeds at once
to open, mounting a convenient stump by way of a
rostrum. Then he commences to read&mdash;the Riot
Act, one would say, looking at the seething, roaring
mob around. In fact, it is the proclamation of the
Ohinemuri gold-field, under the Mining Act of the
colonial legislature. But no one can hear a word.</p>

<p>Presently the reading is done, the Warden lifts
his cap with a smile, announcing that the field is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
open. A tumult of cheering breaks forth, and then
every one rushes at the clerk's table, and, fighting
and struggling for precedence, dumps down his note
(£1) for the "Miner's Right," which is his license
and authority to dig for gold within the limits of the
field.</p>

<p>I cannot describe that fierce conflict round the
table and tent; it is all confusion in my mind. It is
a wild jumble of warring words, and furiously
struggling shoulders and elbows, arms and legs.
Somehow we get our licenses early, mainly owing,
I think, to the stalwart proportions and weighty
muscles of the Little'un and O'Gaygun. Out of the
plunging crowd we fight and tear our way, duly
armed with our "authorities." As does every one
so do we, namely, fling ourselves on our horses'
backs, and ride headlong across the country in the
direction of the Gorge.</p>

<p>What a race that is! No run with a pack of
English foxhounds could compare with it. Never a
fox-hunter that dared have ridden as we rode that
day, across a country so rough and shaggy. But
our incitement is greater than ever fox-hunter had,
for it is a frantic chase for wealth, with all the
madness of gambling thrown into it. It is a race
whose goal is gold!</p>

<p>There is no road, of course. Our way lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
across a country jungled with fern and scrub and
bush. The ground is broken with abrupt descents
and short but rugged rises. There are streams and
marshes to be plunged through or jumped over.
There are devious twists and turns to be made to
avoid insurmountable obstacles. Scarce is there a
track to show the way, merely the faintest indication
of one cut through the wooded tracts by the surveyor's
gang. And we have six miles and more to
make, riding with frantic eagerness and reckless
speed, conscious that two thousand men have entered
for the race, and that only a few can win.</p>

<p>Thoroughly well mounted, and accustomed from
our cattle-driving experiences to such rough riding
as this, we four chums do justice to the start we
managed to get. Not more than a score or so are
ahead of us, and some of them we are overhauling.</p>

<p>There are dozens of casualties, of course. As
we gallop along I see a man and horse go down, on
the steep side of a gully. They roll over together,
and together flounder to the bottom. The unlucky
rider screams with pain, for his legs and ribs are
broken, and calls to us to help him. We hesitate
half a moment, but the gold-fever is on us, and
we hurry on. At such a time humanity is dead,
even in the most honourable breast. It is like a
battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, Dandy Jack and O'Gaygun are in front
of me. Before them rides a regular Thames miner,
bestriding a lean and weedy horse of very poor
description. It is easy to see, too, that he is not
accustomed to the saddle, though he is urging his
beast to its utmost, and doing all he knows to get
on. We are coursing along the side of a slope,
dense ti-tree jungle above and below us, and only
a rough narrow way through it. The miner's horse
ahead stumbles and trips, grows frightened, and
becomes unmanageable, turning broadside on in the
narrow path and blocking it.</p>

<p>I hear Dandy Jack and O'Gaygun shout in
warning, but the miner has no time to get out of
their way. Riding abreast they charge down upon
him, utterly regardless of consequences. Over goes
horse and man beneath the shock of their rushing
steeds, and, a moment later, my nag leaps over the
fallen and follows at their heels.</p>

<p>Oh, the rush and fury of that ride! My head
still swims as I think of it. All sense of care is
gone; all thought of risk or accident banished. A
wild, mad excitement surges through every vein,
and boils up within my brain. I only know that
hundreds are hurrying after me, and before me
there is a dazzle and glitter of gold. Who heeds
the fallen, the vanquished, the beaten in the race?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
Who cares for peril to life or limb? There is but
one idea the mind can hold&mdash;on! on!</p>

<p>By-and-by, and when our panting, foaming horses
seem utterly giving out, responding neither to voice
nor spur, bit nor whip, we find ourselves within the
Gorge. A splendid mountain scene is that, had we
but time to look at it. We have not. Our worn-out
steeds carry us wearily up and along the steep
hill-side, beneath and among the trees that cast their
umbrage all over the golden ground. Climbing,
struggling, pressing ever onward, we pass the grim
defile, and, in the wild and beautiful solitude of
primeval nature, we find our goal.</p>

<p>Through the trees we spy a clearing, lying open
and sunlit on the steep mountain-side. A clearing,
hardly to be so designated, for it is merely a space
of some few acres where fallen, half-burnt trees lie
prostrate, jumbled in inextricable confusion with
boulders, rocks, jutting crags, and broken mounds
of fresh-turned soil and stone. A handkerchief
upon a post, some newly-split and whitened stakes
set here and there around the <i>débris</i>, the babble and
vociferation of men, those who have got before us,
around and about, all sufficiently proclaims that our
race is at an end, and that this before us is the
prospectors' claim.</p>

<p>There is no time to be lost, for many behind us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
are coming on, and will be upon the ground a few
minutes later. And more and more are coming,
pressing onward from the rear with feverish ardour.
We spring from our now useless steeds and hasten
to select our ground. Above, and on each side,
nay, even immediately below the prospectors' claim,
those lucky first ones are already pegging out their
lawful areas. Depending on certain indications that
a hasty glance reveals, and on advice that Dandy
Jack has previously received in mysterious confidence
from one of the prospectors, we pass below
the ground already seized, and there, a little to the
right, we proceed to set up the stakes and clear
the ground that we claim as ours.</p>

<p>As we proceed to make the dispositions which
secure to us that which we have already named
"O'Gaygun's Claim," the row and racket around
rings fiercer over the mountain side. Parties of
men are arriving every moment on the ground, and
proceeding at once to map out rock and bush into
squares and parallelograms, and to peg out their
several claims. With the prospectors' claim for
centre and nucleus, the area of the occupied ground
momentarily increases. Above, around, below, we
are hemmed in by earth-hungry gold-seekers, who
each and all are greedy as starved tigers for their
prey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>Not without many disputes is the work accomplished.
Oath and remonstrance, angry quarrelling
and bandying of words soon transform that peaceful
fastness of nature into a pandemonium of humanity;
and words give place to blows, as boundaries are
fixed, and claims measured off. Fierce fights are
waged over many an inch and yard of ground.
The heated blood of the gold-seeker brooks little
opposition, and I fear that even revolvers and
knives are shown, if not used, between rival
claimants.</p>

<p>Yet the hot fury of the rush subsides after a
time, and each party proceeds to investigate what
authority allows it, and to reconcile divisions with
its neighbours. Fires are built and camps are
formed, for no one dare leave his claim unoccupied,
and preparations are made for a night more confused
and uncomfortable than those previously spent at
the Warden's camp.</p>

<p>Next day the work commences. The Warden
and his aids register the claims and their respective
owners. Parties are told off to cut and construct
a road. Miners begin to build up huts and habitations,
and to bring up from the river their swags,
provisions, and tools. Trees fall beneath the axe;
rocks are shattered and the ground disturbed with
pick and spade; while pounding and panning, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>saying
and testing goes on vigorously. For no one
knows exactly how the reefs will run, or where the
richest stone will be found. Nor can that be more
than conjectured until tunnelling has been carried
to some depth. Most of the claims will prove
abortive and valueless; only a few will yield paying
quantities of gold; only one or two, perhaps, will
bring wealth to their owners. We work and hope.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three months later, what have been the results,
and what are the prospects? I stand at the door
of the rude hut we live in, and look abroad over the
gold-field, pondering. It is evening, a memorable
evening for us, as will presently appear. But we
are depressed and down-spirited, for luck has not
been with us. "O'Gaygun's Claim" is apparently
one of the blankest of blanks in the lottery of the
gold-field.</p>

<p>What a difference is apparent in the scene around
from that it presented three months ago, when we
rode here in wild excitement and hot haste. The
grand and lonely Gorge is now populous with life.
Trees have fallen beneath the axe, and even their
stumps have altogether disappeared over a great
extent. The wide hill-side has been riven and torn
and excavated by pick and spade, and gaping
tunnels yawn here and there. Houses and huts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
and tents have risen all around, and a rough young
town now hangs upon the mountain's shoulder.</p>

<p>Newness and rawness and crudity are prevailing
features of the place, yet still it begins to look like
the abode and workshop of civilized men. Stores
and hotels, primitive but encouraging, hang out
their signs to view; and a road, rough but practicable,
winds down across the lower ground to Paeroa,
the river landing-place, where, too, another township
is being nursed into existence. Down below
a couple of crushing-mills are already set up and
hard at work, belching forth volumes of smoke, that
almost hides from my view the turbid, muddy waters
of the creek in the gully, as it rolls furiously along.
The thunder and thud of the batteries, the jarring
and whirring of machinery, the bustle and stir of
active and unceasing toil, reverberate with noisy
clamour among the rocks, and proclaim that this
stronghold of wild nature has been captured and
occupied by man.</p>

<p>We four chums have not done well; indeed, we
have done very badly. We have prospected our
claim in all directions, but without success, and are
now sinking a tunnel deep into the hill-side, in hopes
of striking the reef that ought, we think, to run in
a certain direction from where its upper levels are
being successfully quarried in the prospectors' claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
above us. We have stuck to the claim so far,
urged by some fanciful belief not to give it up, and
it bids fair to ruin us. Our funds are quite exhausted,
and in another week we shall be compelled
to give up the claim, to take work on wages here
or at Grahamstown, and so raise means to get ourselves
back to the Kaipara.</p>

<p>For the expenses have been great. What with
buying provisions at frightful prices, buying implements
and some bits of machinery, paying for the
crushing of quartz that never yielded more than
delusive traces of gold, and so on and so forth, our
slender capital has melted away into nothingness.
True, we have formed ourselves into a company,
and have tried to sell some scrip. But the market
is flooded with mining shares just now, and ours are
not worth a bottle of whisky apiece. Moreover,
"O'Gaygun's Claim" is fast becoming the laughing-stock
of the field. There are no believers in it
except ourselves. Every other claim that proved
as valueless as ours has been long ago abandoned;
only we stick to our tunnel, driving at it with frantic
energy. And our life is harder here than in our
shanty. We are ill-provided, and have all the wet
and mud and mire of the rainy season now to help
make things uncomfortable for us. Our food is coarse,
and not too plentiful. Damper, tea, salt-pork,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
potatoes, and not always all of those. Is it any
wonder we are despondent?</p>

<p>As I stand there that evening, cogitating over
the gloomy outlook, two of the others come out of
the tunnel bearing a sackful of stone between them.
I see a new expression on their faces, and eagerly
turn to them.</p>

<p>"Something fresh. Hush! Not a word. Come
into the house, quick!"</p>

<p>So says Dandy Jack to me, hoarsely and hurriedly.
Alas! poor man, he is hardly a dandy at
present, and even his complacent calm seems to
have forsaken him at last.</p>

<p>In the hut we anxiously crowd together, examining
the specimens just brought out of the mine.
There are lumps of grey and dirty-white quartz,
flecked with little spots and speckles of metallic
yellow. Is it gold? That is the question.</p>

<p>"Ah! it's just the same ould story!" growls
O'Gaygun. "Mica or pyrites, that's about all we've
the luck to find, bad cess to them! All's not gould
that glitters, boys; an' there's precious little av the
thrue stuff comin' our way."</p>

<p>"Shut up, you Irish croaker!" says Dandy Jack,
without moving, as he lies on his face near the fire,
intently examining a piece of quartz, licking it with
his tongue, scratching it with his nails, and hefting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
it in his palms. "There's many a rough dirty stone
that hides good gold within it. And," he adds,
rising up, "we <i>have</i> got it this time. Boys! <i>we've
struck the reef!</i>"</p>

<p>A few minutes later we were scouring down to
the battery, bearing samples of the precious stone;
and before the camp had gone to rest that night
a hubbub and excitement had spread through it, for,
it was the common topic of talk that rich stone had
been discovered upon "O'Gaygun's Claim." Next
day and next week we were besieged. Crowds
wanted to see the claim, numbers wanted to buy
shares in it, and would give hundreds and even
thousands of pounds for them. We were elate,
excited, conceited, madder than ever with our luck,
that at last had come.</p>

<p>Well, eventually it proved that the find was but
a "blind reef," a "pocket," a mere isolated dribble
from the main continuous vein we had at first supposed
we had struck. But it filled our pockets,
giving us more wealth than we had ever before
possessed. Had we been wiser we might have
made more money by selling the claim directly after
the find; but we held on too long. However, we
made a very pretty little pile, not a fortune exactly,
but the nucleus of one; and finally we sold the
claim for a good round sum to a joint stock com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>pany,
cleared out, and separated on the various ways
we had chalked out for ourselves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I find I can write no more, for many things are
happening. O'Gaygun has set up as a stockbroker
in Auckland, and will gamble away his share of
our luck in gold-mine scrip. Dandy Jack has
bought a large improved farm, and is collecting and
importing a stud of brood mares. He is going to
develop the equine resources of the colony. The
Little'un has gone to Canterbury, intending to run
sheep upon a large scale. And I am going to
Australia and Fiji, perhaps home to England&mdash;who
knows!</p>

<p>At Te Pahi amazing progress is taking place.
A wharf is being constructed at the township, and
a fine new steamer is being contracted for. Some
new settlers have been tempted to come up into the
district, and gangs of workmen are being hired from
afar. A church has been subscribed for, and will
soon be built. The Saint is erecting an hotel; and
the Fiend is putting up a flour-mill. Old Colonial
is going to get married, and a grand mansion, in the
style of the Member's residence, is going up near
the site of our shanty.</p>

<p>As I stand on the deck of the vessel that bears
me away from New Zealand, I am filled with pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>found
regrets at leaving the life I have grown to
love so well. But it is not for long; only for a
season have I said farewell to the friends with whom
I have toiled and struggled so long. I shall return
some day, soon, to make my home in the beautiful
land where the kauri grows. And the sun shines
more brilliantly than ever upon the shores receding
from my gaze, fit emblem of the prosperity of that
glad new country, which we who love it like to call
our "Brighter Britain."</p>

<p>N.B. I cannot claim that the above list is a complete one.
It is not. It merely contains the books I have been able to come
across. Dr. Thomson compiled a careful list of all publications
relating to New Zealand down to the year 1859. Such a task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
would be very much more arduous now, and the result would not
repay the trouble bestowed on it. There have been, both before
and since 1859, shoals of pamphlets bearing on matters connected
with the colony. Since that year, too, the periodical literature of
Great Britain, Australia, the United States, and other countries,
has contained countless articles on New Zealand subjects.
Finally, "Brighter Britain" has now a literature of its own. Its
press and its publishers are busy. Yet, I think, that in the foregoing
catalogue will be found all, or nearly all, the substantial
volumes immediately relating to New Zealand that the general
reader, or particular inquirer, need care to become acquainted
with.</p>

list. The materials were not collected without considerable trouble, and every care has been
taken to ensure fulness. The figures are derived from returns published according to the census
and estimates of 1879 and 1880. Their incompleteness was unavoidable.</p>

<h3>POLITICAL DIVISIONS.</h3>

<p>In 1876, the old provincial divisions, with all their cumbrous local
governments and legislative machinery, were finally abolished.
Politically speaking, therefore, the provinces of Auckland,
Taranaki, Hawke's Bay, Wellington, Nelson, Marlborough, Canterbury,
Otago, and Westland no longer exist. The names are still
retained to some extent in general use, but they will probably pass
away as the new arrangement takes deeper hold. The colony is
now divided into sixty-three counties, which are here enumerated,
together with the three principal cities, towns, villages, or settlements
comprised within each. The arrangement is from North
to South.</p>

<h3>PRONUNCIATION OF MAORI NAMES.</h3>

<p>The letters of the Maori Alphabet are only fourteen in number.
They are&mdash;a, e, h, i, k, m, n, ng, o, p, r, t, u, w. The vowels
have an Italian sound.</p>
<div class="center small">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>The Maori</td><td>a</td><td>is pronounced like</td><td align="left">aw and ah.</td></tr>
<tr><td> " </td><td>e</td><td> " </td><td align="left">a and eh.</td></tr>
<tr><td> " </td><td>i</td><td> " </td><td align="left">ee.</td></tr>
<tr><td> " </td><td>o</td><td> " </td><td align="left">o and oo (short).</td></tr>
<tr><td> " </td><td>u</td><td> " </td><td align="left">oo (long).</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>When two vowels come together in a syllable, both are pronounced
in a single breath. Thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="center small">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>The Maori</td><td>au</td><td align="left">becomes ow, as in <i>cow</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td> " </td><td>ao</td><td align="left">ao the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td> " </td><td>ae</td><td align="left">ae becomes i, as in <i>sigh</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td> " </td><td>ai</td><td align="left">ai the same.</td></tr>
<tr><td> " </td><td>ei</td><td align="left">ei becomes ee, as in <i>keep</i>.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Ng always has a nasal sound, as in <i>ringing</i>. G is never hard.</p>

<p>In common use among colonists, many names are becoming
corrupted, principally by the shortening of vowel sounds. Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
Wakatipu, the proper pronunciation of which should be Waw-kah-tee´-poo,
has become Wacky-tip. The elision of a final vowel in
certain instances, is common among the Maori themselves.</p>

<p>The following examples, selected from names occurring in this
book, may be of use. Chief stress is to be laid upon the syllable
indicated by an accent mark.</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
